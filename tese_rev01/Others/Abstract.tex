This thesis presents an investigation into the analysis of time series through the functions \dfa, \dcca~and, mainly, the coefficients \pdcca~and \dmc. It presents a bibliographic research focused on methods based on \dfa~that treat multi-correlation and the applications of these functions and coefficients in Environmental Sciences. We also present articles produced in the process of this thesis, dealing with the application of the coefficients \pdcca~and \dmc.

The implementation of a computational tool (the \emph{Python} \emph{Zebende} library) for manipulating time series and calculating the functions and coefficients is presented, as well as the \emph{Detrended Saved} algorithm, an innovative strategy in the general calculation of \dcca, but with advantages in performance when used for calculations of many series among themselves (such as in the case of matrix construction of \pdcca~to calculate \dmc, when a large number of time series is used). The capacity of the \emph{Zebende} library to enhance the use of these coefficients is also presented.
