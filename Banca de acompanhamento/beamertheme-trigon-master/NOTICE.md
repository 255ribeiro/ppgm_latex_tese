### Metropolis

Trigon is heavily inspired by the [Metropolis theme][metro-repo], which is
available under the [CC-BY-SA-4.0] license with the following copyright:

> Copyright 2015 Matthias Vogelgesang and the LaTeX community. A full list of
> contributors can be found at:
> <https://github.com/matze/mtheme/graphs/contributors>
> and the original template was based on the HSRM theme by Benjamin Weiss.

As Trigon can be viewed as a derivative work of Metropolis, it must therefore be
released under CC-BY-SA-4.0 as well.

_Personal commentary_: I am not really fan of that license, as the CC-BY-SA 4.0
(or any other creative common license) is not adapted for software and codes.
[Creative Commons even explicitly advise against using their licenses for
software in their FAQ][1].
Instead, they suggest the use of proper open-source licenses, such as the
[GPL-3.0] or [MIT] for instance. For the specific case of latex packages, the
recommended license is the [LaTeX Project Public License][LPPL], although the
previous two are also commonly used.

I already [voiced my concerns][2] on the Metropolis github repository, but this
has not be answered so far.
