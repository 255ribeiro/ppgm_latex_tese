Based on techniques from graphic statics, the force distribution in building structures is visualized using geometric diagrams. This diagrammatic representation allows a formal description that shows the relationship between the force flow and the structural form. The formal character of this description enables the direct implementation of a parametric truss geometry that maintains major structural behavioral characteristics under deformation. An interactive model of a structural freeform roof is developed through this link between a parametric truss definition and a design-driving NURBS surface. This allows for an intuitive exploration of the constrained design space in real time. Formal explorations and the comparison with built examples demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.},

In this paper, Annual and monthly maxima of daily temperature and rainfall data dating from 1901--2016 and 1950--2018 are characterized for nine countries within the greater horn of Africa. The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is fitted to the data sets from each of the nine countries using the method of maximum likelihood. Both the location and scale parameters of the GEV is formulated as a function of time to account for variability and trends in the extremes of temperature and rainfall so that their future behavior can be predicted. Based on our results, We provide return levels for the years 2, 10, 50 100, and 200 which could be used as measures of flood protection. To understand the spatial cross-correlation patterns on different time scales in each country and how rainfall and temperature are related to agricultural variables, we utilize the detrended cross-correlation coefficient({$\rho$}DCCA) and its generalization, (DMCx2) to account for that, respectively. Given the results of the (DMCx2) and the fact that climate extremes pose a huge threat to agriculture and food security, we employed copula based models to describe the structure of dependence between climatic variables and the crop related variables such as yield and production quantity. The results from the copula analysis show that irrespective of the country, climatic factors and the agricultural products(production/yield) the strongest dependence is demonstrated by the pairs involving cereal crops, while the weakest dependence is characterized by the pairs involving regular potato.},

In this paper, we design a deep-learning framework that combines convolution operations on graph data with recurrent neural networks to solve the short-term traffic data forecasting problem. The proposed model takes into account recent, daily, and weekly periodic time series to capture different patterns in traffic flow. The experimental study of the model conducted on publicly available real-world datasets shows that the proposed model outperforms other baseline methods.},

  abstract = {In this study, a novel spatiotemporal graph convolutional networks model is proposed for traffic flow prediction in urban road networks by fully considering an information geometry approach and attention-based mechanism. Accurate traffic flow prediction in real urban road networks is challenging due to the presence of dynamic spatiotemporal data and external factors in the urban environment. Moreover, the dynamic spatial and temporal dependencies of urban traffic flow data are very important for predicting traffic flow, and it has been shown that a recent attention mechanism has a relatively good ability to capture these dynamic dependencies, which are not fully considered by most existing algorithms. Therefore, in the novel model abbreviated as IGAGCN, the information geometry method is utilized to determine the dynamic data distribution difference between different sensors. The attention mechanism is employed with the information geometry method, in which a matrix is derived by analyzing the distributions of sensor data, and the spatiotemporal dynamic connections in traffic flow data features are better at capturing the spatial dependencies of traffic between different sensors in urban road networks. Furthermore, a parallel sub-model architecture is proposed to consider long time spans, where each dilated causal convolution sub-model is applied to short time spans. Two well-known data sets were employed to demonstrate that our proposed method obtains better performance and is better at capturing the dynamic spatial dependencies of traffic than the existing only-attention-based models. In addition a real-world urban road network in Shenzhen, China, was studied to test and verify the proposed model.},

Together with the technique of feature based modelling, modelling with constraints has widely affected the development of new CAD-systems. The architecture of so called parametric CAD-systems reflects the impact of these new technologies. Besides the new hybrid modellers of geometry and topology, the sketcher and the constraint solver have become key components in a parametric CAD-system. The sketcher may be regarded as a designer interface for modelling with constraints. Moreover rule-based methods of automatic constraint detection are applied in sketchers. Constraint solvers evaluate the network of constraints formulated by the sketcher as a set of equations or predicates using numeric or symbolic algorithms or rule based approaches. The article closes with a summary of the advantages and risks of designing with constraints, showing typical application fields of this modelling technique and discussing some open issues.},

In order to this paradigm becomes largely adopted and fully utilized, the interoperability issue must be properly addressed. While the IFC schema covers the data model necessary for data exchange, the processes occurring daily in the industry need to be better known. In this sense, this paper reports a research that explored the design process of reinforced concrete structures using BIM based systems. To reach this goal, a case study was developed in a structural design company, where the researcher collected data by participant observation, interviews and documental analysis. After the data collection and the analysis of the internal design routines and external communications during the design process, process maps were elaborated containing all the activities developed during the contracted projects. Furthermore, it was appropriately registered the information requirements for each one of the activities using the IDM (Information Delivery Manual) standards. It was possible to characterize the design process of reinforced concrete structures in the studied company when using BIM based systems, as well as to identify the stakeholder information requirements. After the processes and information flows analysis it was also possible to propose a new optimized workflow. This workflow aimed to reduce the number of analogic activities during the studied design process, as well as helped to propose new information exchanges following the IDM methodology.},

  abstract = {Generative systems have been widely used to produce two- and three-dimensional constructs, in an attempt to escape from our preconceptions and pre-existing spatial language. The challenge is to use this mechanism in real-world architectural contexts in which complexity and constraints imposed by the design problem make it difficult to negotiate between the emergent output, the context, and the controllability desired by the human designer. This thesis investigates how generative systems address contextual parameters, including the designer, client, user, meaning, aesthetics, environment, and function. This is demonstrated through my case studies, in which my aim was to avoid computerized unprocessed formalism that does not implicitly allow for any contextual and cultural content. I sought to extend simple algorithmic form-generation processes to allow for the subtleties of a given context to be effectively addressed. Some challenges and questions arose from these case studies. By interrogating different generative machines, common threads and challenges, similar to mine encountered in the case studies, were found. All of the processes that strove towards the creation of a generative system struggled with similar issues: How can we use rule-based systems without sacrificing meaning or function or the humanistic touch?

We conduct multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DXA) on the daily SSR from four major economies (USA, Eurozone, Japan, and UK) and the daily prices of four energy markets (WTI, Brent, Natural Gas, and Heating Oil) spanning January 1995 to March 2022. Our analysis shows that all energy market-short shadow rate pairs display significant multifractal characteristics. The presence of power law cross-correlation suggests that substantial changes in short shadow rates are associated with significant price changes in energy markets. The highest multifractal cross-correlation is observed between energy prices and shadow short rates of Japan and the US. Energy markets demonstrate persistent cross-correlations for small fluctuations compared to large fluctuations. However, the rolling windows analysis reveal a shift from persistent to anti-persistence cross-correlations during global financial crises (GFC), the 2014--2016 energy crises and the COVID-19 pandemic. Lastly, the cross-correlation exhibit positive skewness. We suggest that integrating these long-term dependency features into financial analysis has the potential to support decision-making for market participants.},

  abstract = {Over the last two decades, scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has become a very popular and widespread technique, with the number of publications and presentations making use of STEM techniques increasing by about an order of magnitude. Although the strengths of the technique for providing high-resolution structural and analytical information have been known and understood for much longer than that, the key to its more recent popularity has undoubtedly been the availability of STEM modes on instruments available from the major TEM manufacturers. Gone are the days when researchers want- ing the unique capabilities of high-resolution STEM had to undertake the task of keeping a VG dedicated STEM instrument operating. Given the current interest in the technique, we felt that the time was right to review the current state of knowledge about STEM and STEM-related techniques and their application to a range of materials problems. The purpose of this volume is both to educate those who wish to deepen their understanding of STEM and to inform those who are seeking a review of the latest applications and methods associated with STEM. We are delighted that so many of our colleagues accepted our invitation to contribute to this volume, and we are indebted to them for their efforts in creating such excellent contributions. The follow- ing chapters illustrate how close STEM has brought us to the ultimate materials characterisation challenge of analysing materials atom by atom. We hope that the following chapters demonstrate the spectacular results that can be achieved when performing the relatively simple experiment of focusing a beam of electrons down to an atomic scale and measuring the scattering that results.

We applied this framework on a model for acoustic impedance of well log data, as a function of neutron effective porosity, shale volume, and resistivity. We find that the neutron effective porosity is more important for modeling acoustic impedance than resistivity and, that both are more important than the shale volume, for all scales. Results from Intersection-Union test suggest the rejection of compound null hypothesis for neutron effective porosity and resistivity for scales between 40 and 500 ft, suggesting a robust model for acoustic impedance based on neutron effective porosity and resistivity on these scales. This approach represents a novel framework for scale sensitive regression models, and we believe that it can be useful for time series studies in many diverse areas.},

Even if sophisticated search algorithms play an important role in solving constraint-based models, the real power engine behind CP is called constraint propagation (domain filtering, pruning or consistency techniques). In the paper we give a survey of common consistency techniques for binary constraints. We describe the main ideas behind them, list their advantages and limitations, and compare their pruning power. Then we briefly explain how these techniques can be extended to non-binary constraints. Last part of the paper is devoted to modelling issues. We give some hints how the constraint propagation can be exploited more when solving real-life problems. This part is based on our experience with solving real-life programs and it is also supported by empirical observations of other researchers.},

In this sense, we analyzed the time series monthly of Latin American countries for the period from 1991 to 2015. Furthermore, we apply Granger causality to verify the direction of causality between foreign exchange and stock market and detrended cross-correlation approach ({$\rho$}DCCA) for any co-movements at different time scales. Our empirical results suggest a positive cross correlation between exchange rate and stock price for all Latin American countries. The findings reveal two clear patterns of correlation. First, Brazil and Argentina have positive correlation in both short and long time frames. Second, the remaining countries are negatively correlated in shorter time scale, gradually moving to positive. This paper contributes to the field in three ways. First, we verified the co-movements of exchange rate and stock prices that were rarely discussed in previous empirical studies. Second, {$\rho$}DCCA coefficient is a robust and powerful methodology to measure the cross correlation when dealing with non stationarity of time series. Third, most of the studies employed one or two time scales using co-integration and vector autoregressive approaches. Not much is known about the co-movements at varying time scales between foreign exchange and stock markets. {$\rho$}DCCA coefficient facilitates the understanding of its explanatory depth.},

  abstract = {Graphical statics is an almost forgotten, intuitive drawing method for solving plane mechanical problems. It was already in use in the 19th century for biomechanical problems. It was still a standard method employed by civil engineers in the 1940s. Superceded by modern analytical methods, graphical statics disappeared almost completely. The method is restricted to plane static problems, but still remains a useful tool for visualizing, understanding and checking the actions of force groups occurring in modern biomechanical problems. After defining the basic mechanical terminology (body, motion, forces), the paper is written mainly as a teaching tool for immediate application. Many illustrative examples (sporting activities, functional forces in joints) help to clarify the difficult biomechanical content. For application, it must be assumed that the bodies investigated behave as rigid bodies under the action of the forces, but this does not prevent application of the method to deformable living bodies if specific static configurations of the bodies are considered. The application of the method requires a good anatomical knowledge and experience with the function of the musculo-skeletal apparatus of living bodies. If reliable models are used, the method delivers quantitative results of sufficient accuracy. The paper may also help provide a better understanding of publications containing graphical solutions to bio-static problems. Die graphische Statik ist eine fast vergessene, intuitive zeichnerische Methode zur L{\"o}sung von mechanischen Problemen in einer Ebene. Sie wurde bereits im 19. Jahrhundert f{\"u}r biomechanische Probleme verwendet. Noch in den 40er Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts war sie eine von Bauingenieuren angewendete Standardmethode. Abgel{\"o}st von modernen analytischen Methoden, verschwand die graphische Statik fast vollst{\"a}ndig. Die Methode ist auf ebene Statikprobleme beschr{\"a}nkt, aber sie ist immer noch ein n{\"u}tzliches Werkzeug zur Veranschaulichung, zum Verst{\"a}ndnis und zur Kontrolle der Wirkung von Kr{\"a}ftegruppen, die bei modernen biomechanischen Problemen auftreten. Im Anschluss an die Definition der grundlegenden mechanischen Terminologie (K{\"o}rper, Bewegung, Kr{\"a}fte) ist der Artikel haupts{\"a}chlich als Lehrmittel zur unmittelbaren Anwendung gedacht. Zahlreiche Anschauungsbeispiele (sportliche Aktivit{\"a}ten, funktionelle Kr{\"a}fte in Gelenken) helfen bei der Erkl{\"a}rung des schwierigen biomechanischen Inhalts. F{\"u}r die Anwendung muss davon ausgegangen werden, dass die zu erforschenden K{\"o}rper sich unter der Kr{\"a}fteeinwirkung wie starre K{\"o}rper verhalten, was jedoch die Anwendung der Methode auf verformbare lebendige K{\"o}rper nicht ausschliesst, wenn spezifische statische Konfigurationen der K{\"o}rper ber{\"u}cksichtigt werden. Die Anwendung der Methode erfordert gute anatomische Kenntnisse und Erfahrung mit der Funktionsweise der Skelettmuskulatur lebender K{\"o}rper. Wenn zuverl{\"a}ssige Modelle verwendet werden, liefert die Methode ausreichend exakte quantitative Resultate. Der Artikel kann ebenfalls zu einem besseren Verst{\"a}ndnis von Ver{\"o}ffentlichungen mit graphischen L{\"o}sungen von bio-statischen Problemen beitragen. La statique graphique, une m{\'e}thode intuitive largement oubli{\'e}e, permet la r{\'e}solution de probl{\`e}mes de m{\'e}canique bidimensionnelle.

Mais, avec le d{\'e}veloppement de m{\'e}thodes analytiques modernes, la statique graphique est tomb{\'e}e dans l'oubli. Bien qu'applicable qu'aux probl{\`e}mes statiques bidimensionnelles, elle reste un outil int{\'e}ressant pour mieux visualiser, comprendre et valider les actions de groupes de forces rencontr{\'e}s dans les probl{\`e}mes modernes de biom{\'e}canique. Apr{\`e}s avoir d{\'e}fini les termes m{\'e}caniques appropri{\'e}s (corps, mouvement, force), cet article se pr{\'e}sente principalement comme un outil de formation permettant une application imm{\'e}diate. Plusieurs exemples (activit{\'e}s sportives, forces fonctionnelles articulaires) illustrent sa capacit{\'e}{\`a}rendre plus lisible des probl{\`e}mes de biom{\'e}canique complexe. Lorsqu'on applique cette m{\'e}thode, on accepte l'hypoth{\`e}se que les corps{\'e}tudi{\'e}s et soumis{\`a}une force agissent en tant que corps rigides. Ceci n'est pas en contradiction avec son application aux corps vivants d{\'e}formables si l'on{\'e}tudie leurs configurations statiques sp{\'e}cifiques. La m{\'e}thode demande une bonne connaissance de l'anatomie fonctionnelle de l'appareil locomoteur des corps vivants. En se servant de mod{\`e}les fiables, elle permet l'acquisition de donn{\'e}es quantitatives d'une pr{\'e}cision satisfaisante. Le but de cet article est de favoriser une meilleure compr{\'e}hension des publications pr{\'e}sentant des solutions graphiques de probl{\`e}mes de biom{\'e}canique statique. La est{\'a}tica gr{\'a}fica es un m{\'e}todo de dibujo intuitivo, casi olvidado, para resolver problemas mec{\'a}nicos en el plano. Ya se utilizaba en el siglo XIX para los problemas biomec{\'a}nicos. En los an{\texttildelow}os cuarenta era todav{\'i}a el m{\'e}todo est{\'a}ndar utilizado por los ingenieros civiles. Sustituida por los m{\'e}todos anal{\'i}ticos modernos, la est{\'a}tica gr{\'a}fica desapareci{\'o}casi por completo. El m{\'e}todo ha quedado limitado a problemas est{\'a}ticos en el plano pero sigue siendo una herramienta{\'u}til a la hora de visualizar, entender y verificar las acciones de grupos de fuerzas que se dan en los problemas biomec{\'a}nicos modernos. Tras definir la terminolog{\'i}a mec{\'a}nica b{\'a}sica (cuerpo, movimiento, fuerzas), el trabajo se ha escrito principalmente a modo de herramienta de ensen{\texttildelow}anza para aplicaci{\'o}n inmediata. La inclusi{\'o}n de muchos ejemplos ilustrativos (actividades deportivas, fuerzas funcionales en las articulaciones) ayudan a aclarar el dif{\'i}cil contenido biomec{\'a}nico. Para su aplicaci{\'o}n, es necesario asumir que los cuerpos investigados se comportan como cuerpos r{\'i}gidos bajo la acci{\'o}n de las fuerzas, pero esto no implica que no pueda aplicarse el m{\'e}todo a cuerpos vivos deformables siempre que se consideren configuraciones est{\'a}ticas espec{\'i}ficas de estos cuerpos. La aplicaci{\'o}n del m{\'e}todo requiere poseer un buen conocimiento anat{\'o}mico y experiencia en el funcionamiento del aparato musculoesquel{\'e}tico de los cuerpos vivos. Si se utilizan modelos fiables, el m{\'e}todo proporciona unos resultados cuantitativos de una precisi{\'o}n suficiente.

  abstract = {In this paper, the effects of uncertainty and expected costs of failure on optimum structural design are investigated, by comparing three distinct formulations of structural optimization problems. Deterministic Design Optimization (DDO) allows one the find the shape or configuration of a structure that is optimum in terms of mechanics, but the formulation grossly neglects parameter uncertainty and its effects on structural safety. Reliability-based Design Optimization (RBDO) has emerged as an alternative to properly model the safety-under-uncertainty part of the problem. With RBDO, one can ensure that a minimum (and measurable) level of safety is achieved by the optimum structure. However, results are dependent on the failure probabilities used as constraints in the analysis. Risk optimization (RO) increases the scope of the problem by addressing the compromising goals of economy and safety. This is accomplished by quantifying the monetary consequences of failure, as well as the costs associated with construction, operation and maintenance. RO yields the optimum topology and the optimum point of balance between economy and safety. Results are compared for some example problems. The broader RO solution is found first, and optimum results are used as constraints in DDO and RBDO. Results show that even when optimum safety coefficients are used as constraints in DDO, the formulation leads to configurations which respect these design constraints, reduce manufacturing costs but increase total expected costs (including expected costs of failure). When (optimum) system failure probability is used as a constraint in RBDO, this solution also reduces manufacturing costs but by increasing total expected costs. This happens when the costs associated with different failure modes are distinct. Hence, a general equivalence between the formulations cannot be established. Optimum structural design considering expected costs of failure cannot be controlled solely by safety factors nor by failure probability constraints, but will depend on actual structural configuration. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Stereo vision improves such detection by doubling the views of the scene and by giving indirect access to depth information. This depth information can also be used to reduce the set of candidate detection windows. Up to now, most algorithms compute a depth map to discard unpromising detection windows. We propose a novel approach where a stixel world model is computed directly from the stereo images, without computing an intermediate depth map. We experimentally demonstrate that such approach can considerably reduce the set of candidate detection windows at a fraction of the computation cost of previous approaches.},

To address this shortcoming, this paper extends the DCCA in a quantile-based framework to investigate the relationship between WTI crude oil spot price and the S\&P500 index from January 1986 to August 2021 under different oil and stock markets conditions. The approach introduced in this research brings out new and exciting findings on the well-debated oil price-stock markets nexus. By considering four possible scenarios regarding the oil and stock markets conditions, results suggest that the sign and strength of cross-correlations between oil and stock markets vary according to the time scale and market condition. These findings are robust when using daily data and the Brent crude oil spot price. Furthermore, when analyzing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic, findings generally reveal a rise in correlations between the two markets during the pandemic, suggesting the existence of contagion effects between them. Policy implications for both investors and market regulators are subsequently proposed.},

This phenomenon---dubbed as Big Data---has applications for a wide assortment of industries, including the construction industry. The construction industry already deals with large volumes of heterogeneous data; which is expected to increase exponentially as technologies such as sensor networks and the Internet of Things are commoditised. In this paper, we present a detailed survey of the literature, investigating the application of Big Data techniques in the construction industry. We reviewed related works published in the databases of American Association of Civil Engineers (ASCE), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), and Elsevier Science Direct Digital Library. While the application of data analytics in the construction industry is not new, the adoption of Big Data technologies in this industry remains at a nascent stage and lags the broad uptake of these technologies in other fields. To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no comprehensive survey of Big Data techniques in the context of the construction industry. This paper fills the void and presents a wide-ranging interdisciplinary review of literature of fields such as statistics, data mining and warehousing, machine learning, and Big Data Analytics in the context of the construction industry. We discuss the current state of adoption of Big Data in the construction industry and discuss the future potential of such technologies across the multiple domain-specific sub-areas of the construction industry. We also propose open issues and directions for future work along with potential pitfalls associated with Big Data adoption in the industry.},

  abstract = {The progress in the field of Machine Learning (ML) has enabled the automation of tasks that were considered impossible to program until recently. These advancements today have incited firms to seek intelligent solutions as part of their enterprise software stack. Even governments across the globe are motivating firms through policies to tape into ML arena as it promises opportunities for growth, productivity and efficiency. In reflex, many firms embark on ML without knowing what it entails. The outcomes so far are not as expected because the ML, as hyped by tech firms, is not the silver bullet. However, whatever ML offers, firms urge to capitalise it for their competitive advantage. Applying ML to real-life construction industry problems goes beyond just prototyping predictive models. It entails intensive activities which, in addition to training robust ML models, provides a comprehensive framework for answering questions asked by construction folks when intelligent solutions are getting deployed at their premises to substitute or facilitate their decision-making tasks. Existing ML guidelines used in the IT industry are vastly restricted to training ML models. This paper presents guidelines for Applied Machine Learning (AML) in the construction industry from training to operationalising models, which are drawn from our experience of working with construction folks to deliver Construction Simulation Tool (CST). The unique aspect of these guidelines lies not only in providing a novel framework for training models but also answering critical questions related to model confidence, trust, interpretability, bias, feature importance and model extrapolation capabilities. Generally, ML models are presumed black boxes; hence argued that nobody knows what a model learns and how it generates predictions. Even very few ML folks barely know approaches to answer questions asked by the end users. Without explaining the competence of ML, the broader adoption of intelligent solutions in the construction industry cannot be attained. This paper proposed a detailed process for AML to develop intelligent solutions in the construction industry. Most discussions in the study are elaborated in the context of profit margin estimation for new projects.},

  abstract = {Generative Architectural Design permits the automatic (or semiautomatic) generation of architectural objects for a wide range of applications, from archaeological research and reconstruction to digital sketching. In this paper the authors introduce design constraint systems (DCS), their approach to the generation of architectural design with the help of a simple example: The development of the necessary formalisms to generate a family of architectural designs, i.e. simple houses and pagodas. After explaining the formal system the authors introduce an approach for the generation of complex form based on the application of transformations and distortions. Architecture is bound by the constraints of physical reality: Gravitation and the properties of the used materials define the limits in which architectural design is possible. With the recent development of new materials and construction methods however, the ways in which form and physics go together get more complicated. As a result, the shapes of architecture gain more liberty, and more and more complex shapes and structures become possible. While these advances allow for new ways of architectural expression, they also make the design process much more challenging. For this reason new tools are necessary for making this complexity manageable for the architect and enable her to play and experiment with the new possibilities of complex shapes and structures. Design constraint systems can be used as tool for experimentation with complex form. Therefore, the authors dedicate the final part of this paper to a concise delineation of an approach for the generation of complex and irregular shapes and structures. While the examples used are simple, they give an idea of the generality of design constraint systems: By using a two-component approach to the generation of designs (the first component describes the abstract structure of the modelled objects while the second component interprets the structure and generates the actual geometric forms) and allowing the user to adjust both components freely, it can be adapted to all kind of different architectural styles, from historical to contemporary architecture.},

  abstract = {Combinatorial optimization problems are encountered in many areas of science and engineering. Most of these problems are too difficult to be solved optimally, and hence heuristics are used to obtain "good" solutions in reasonable time. One heuristic that has been successfully applied to a variety of problems is Simulated Annealing. The performance of Simulated Annealing depends on the appropriate choice of a key parameter, the annealing schedule. Researchers usually experiment with some manually created annealing schedules and then use the one that performs best in their algorithms. This work replaces this manual search by Genetic Programming, a method based on natural evolution. We demonstrate the potential of this new approach by optimizing the annealing schedule for a well-known combinatorial optimization problem, the Quadratic Assignment Problem. We introduce two new algorithms for solving the Quadratic Assignment Problem that perform extremely well and outperform existing Simulated Annealing algorithms.},

  abstract = {4D modeling has been an applied research area for around two decades since the first seminal works in the nineties. In the last years, a number of case studies have been published both for demonstrating the various applications of 4D and for assessing technological propositions. However, in most papers only little place is given to the particular content of 4D models. In parallel, following the growing implementation of Building Information Modeling, 4D modeling process is usually recognized as a ``BIM use''. In BIM implementations and protocols, the Level Of Development of datasets is a fundamental issue. This paper describes the application of two distinct ``4D uses'' conducted on a single pilot project. They aim to assess the levels of graphical and temporal details required for the implemented uses. The authors finally discuss the diversity of 4D uses with 4D models, both planned or ad-hoc, as well as the logical understanding related to 4D LOD.},

The main purpose of this large effort is to reduce the effects of greenhouse emission, climate change to head for a sustainable society. In this scenario, Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) play a key role. From one side, advances in physical and environmental information sensing, communication and processing, enabled the monitoring of energy behaviour of buildings in real-time. The access to this information has been made easy and ubiquitous thank to Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and protocols. From the other side, the creation of digital repositories of buildings and districts (i.e. Building Information Models-BIM) enabled the development of complex and rich energy models that can be used for simulation and prediction purposes. As such, an opportunity is emerging of mixing these two information categories to either create better models and to detect unwanted or inefficient energy behaviours. In this paper, we present a software architecture for management and simulation of energy behaviours in buildings that integrates heterogeneous data such as BIM, IoT, GIS (Geographical Information System) and meteorological services. This integration allows: I) (near-) real-time visualisation of energy consumption information in the building context and ii) building performance evaluation through energy modelling and simulation exploiting data from the field and real weather conditions. Finally, we discuss the experimental results obtained in a real-world case-study.},

  abstract = {A construction tree is a set of shape generation processes commonly produced with CAD modelers during a design process of B-Rep objects. However, a construction tree does not bring all the desired properties in many configurations: dimension modifications, idealization processes, etc. Generating a non trivial set of generative processes, possibly forming a construction graph, can significantly improve the adequacy of some of these generative processes to meet user's application needs. This paper proposes to extract generative processes from a given B-rep shape as a high-level shape description. To evaluate the usefulness of this description, finite element analyses (FEA) and particularly idealizations are the applications selected to evaluate the adequacy of additive generative processes. Non trivial construction trees containing generic extrusion and revolution primitives behave like well established CSG trees. Advantageously, the proposed approach is primitive-based, which ensures that any generative process of the construction graph does preserve the realizability of the corresponding volume. In the context of FEA, connections between idealized primitives of a construction graph can be efficiently performed using their interfaces. Consequently, generative processes of a construction graph become a high-level object structure that can be tailored to idealizations of primitives and robust connections between them.},

Our approach uses standard GPU tessellation hardware and processes each face of a base mesh inde- pendently, thus allowing an entire model to be rendered in a single pass. The key idea of our method is to subdivide the u, v domain of each face ahead of time, generating a quadtree structure, and then submit one tessellated primitive per input face. By traversing the quadtree for each post-tessellation vertex, we are able to accurately and efficiently evaluate the limit surface. Our method yields a more uniform tessellation of the surface, and faster rendering, as fewer primitives are submitted. We evaluate our method on a variety of assets, and realize performance that can be three times faster than state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, our streaming formulation makes it easier to integrate subdivision surfaces into applications and shader code written for polygonal models. We illustrate inte- gration of our technique into a full-featured video game engine.},

In these fields, interdisciplinary research in GIScience and related fields is needed to support the modelling, analysis, management, and integration of large geo-referenced data sets, which describe human activities and geophysical phenomena. Geo-databases may serve as platforms to integrate 2D maps, 3D geo-scientific models, and other geo-referenced data. However, current geo-databases do not provide sufficient 3D data modelling and data handling techniques. New 3D geo-databases are needed to handle surface and volume models. This article first presents a 25-year retrospective of geo-database research. Data modelling, standards, and indexing of geo-data are discussed in detail. New directions for the development of 3D geo-databases to open new fields for interdisciplinary research are addressed. Two scenarios in the fields of early warning and emergency response demonstrate the combined management of human and geophysical phenomena.

  abstract = {Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to address the problem in research of a lack of a holistic conceptual framework related to incremental and discontinuous innovation. Too often, the term ``innovation'' is used without an understanding of how it can be applied in a product design and supply chain fulfillment system. In this study, the goal is to develop a holistic ``innovation continuum'' to treat innovation as a complex adaptive system (CAS). Design/methodology/approach -- A comprehensive literature review was conducted, and from it, four propositions and a conceptual framework were developed. Findings -- The authors determined that an ``innovation continuum'' can be established through the use of a complex adaptive system. Two, incremental innovation is determined to possess adaptive qualities, and can be enhanced through the use of collaboration and evolutionary algorithms. Three, discontinuous innovation is established as a creative process enabled through expert designers, and improved through the use of generative design. Next, a supply chain system for incremental innovation can be assisted by the use of adaptive systems, but it is not proven that a generative customization system (for discontinuous innovation) can be improved through the use of a CAS. Originality/value -- The paper has established an ``innovation continuum'' linking incremental and discontinuous innovation within one holistic system. It establishes the use of evolutionary algorithms to improve the viability of incremental innovation, and generative design for discontinuous innovation. Finally, the concept of generative customization as an end to end product design and supply chain fulfillment solution for discontinuous innovation is established.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}3D city models have become crucial for better city management, and can be used for various purposes such as disaster management, navigation, solar potential computation and planning simulations. 3D city models are not only visual models, and they can also be used for thematic queries and analyzes with the help of semantic data. The models can be produced using different data sources and methods. In this study, vector basemaps and large-format aerial images, which are regularly produced in accordance with the large scale map production regulations in Turkey, have been used to develop a workflow for semi-automatic 3D city model generation. The aim of this study is to propose a procedure for the production of 3D city models from existing aerial photogrammetric datasets without additional data acquisition efforts and/or costly manual editing. To prove the methodology, a 3D city model has been generated with semi-automatic methods at LoD2 (Level of Detail 2) of CityGML (City Geographic Markup Language) using the data of the study area over Cesme Town of Izmir Province, Turkey. The generated model is automatically textured and additional developments have been performed for 3D visualization of the model on the web. The problems encountered throughout the study and approaches to solve them are presented here. Consequently, the approach introduced in this study yields promising results for low-cost 3D city model production with the data at hand.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The results show that the cross-correlations between crude oil prices and three different implied volatility indices are multifractal. By finding the ``crossover'', we separate the three pairs of series into the short- and long-term, respectively, and find that the cross-correlations are strongly anti-persistent in both short- and long-term. Moreover, cross-correlations of small and large fluctuations are anti-persistent in the short- and long-term, suggesting that crude oil prices and implied volatility indices are susceptible to each other. We also find that the cross-correlation exponents are less than the average generalized Hurst exponent when q{\textexclamdown}0 and more than the average generalized Hurst exponent when q{\textquestiondown}0 in the short-term and that the opposite results are true in the long-term.},

  abstract = {Real-world multi-objective engineering design optimization problems often have parameters with uncontrollable variations. The aim of solving such problems is to obtain solutions that in terms of objectives and feasibility are as good as possible and at the same time are least sensitive to the parameter variations. Such solutions are said to be robust optimum solutions. In order to investigate the trade-off between the performance and robustness of optimum solutions, we present a new Robust Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (RMOGA) that optimizes two objectives: a fitness value and a robustness index. The fitness value serves as a measure of performance of design solutions with respect to multiple objectives and feasibility of the original optimization problem. The robustness index, which is based on a non-gradient based parameter sensitivity estimation approach, is a measure that quantitatively evaluates the robustness of design solutions. RMOGA does not require a presumed probability distribution of uncontrollable parameters and also does not utilize the gradient information of these parameters. Three distance metrics are used to obtain the robustness index and robust solutions. To illustrate its application, RMOGA is applied to two well-studied engineering design problems from the literature.},

  abstract = {Much interest has been recently devoted to generative processes in design. Advances in computational tools for design applications, coupled with techniques from the field of artificial intelligence, have lead to new possibilities in the way computers can inform and actively interact with the design process. In this paper, we use the concepts of generative and goal-oriented design to propose a computer tool that can help the designer to generate and evaluate certain aspects of a solution towards an optimized behavior of the final configuration. This work focuses mostly on those aspects related to the environmental performance of buildings. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are applied as a generative and search procedure to look for optimized design solutions in terms of thermal and lighting performance in a building. The GA is first used to generate possible design solutions, which are then evaluated in terms of lighting and thermal behavior using a detailed thermal analysis program (DOE2.1E). The results from the simulations are subsequently used to further guide the GA search towards finding low-energy solutions to the problem under study. Solutions can be visualized using an AutoLisp routine. The specific problem addressed in this study is the placing and sizing of windows in an office building. The same method is applicable to a wide range of design problems like the choice of construction materials, design of shading elements, or sizing of lighting and mechanical systems for buildings. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Abstract The European \{COST\} Sub-Urban Action (TU1206) has had the fundamental aim of closing the knowledge gap between subsurface experts and potential users of subsurface knowledge - urban decision- makers, practitioners and researchers. The Action assembled a network involving \&gt;30 countries, 23 actively participating cities, researchers, practitioners and urban decision-makers, and brought together the fragmented research and good practice across Europe in sustainable urban sub-surface use. Development of national exemplars has been encouraged, and good practice identified to inspire others, using a lighthouse-follower approach to cascade knowledge and good practice across Europe and further afield. Experts from both sides of the knowledge gap were brought together to assess and synthesise the state-of-the-art in lighthouse cities with respect to urban sub-surface knowledge, understanding, and use of that knowledge. This was achieved in 19 City Studies, with findings encapsulated in an over-view report ``Out of Sight - Out of Mind''. Expert sub-groups then identified good practice in subsurface data and knowledge locally, nationally, and Europe-wide. These are highlighted in the synthesis report ``Opening up the subsurface for the cities of tomorrow'', and expanded on in seven topic review reports. These also identified key gaps in knowledge, and its use. A new concept, \{GEOCIM\} is proposed for City Quarter to Conurbation scales, combining subsurface and above-ground models. These enable: a.) holistic urban planning; b.) identifying subsurface opportunities; and c.) saving costs by reducing uncertainty in ground conditions. Finally, the Action's reports and outputs were integrated within an online toolbox, and will be further outlined in the Final Report of the Action, to be made available on the Action's website. The Sub-Urban Toolbox promotes and disseminates the good practice, and decision-support tools: a.) to help better inform and empower city decision- and policy-makers about the sub-surface and the vital importance of its early-stage consideration; and b.) accelerate uptake amongst sub-surface experts of sub-surface modelling workflows. Users with different backgrounds and needs, require different access to, and appropriate translations of, the Sub-Urban Toolbox. Therefore different entry points are provided for sub-surface technical experts, and urban planners, and decision- and policy-makers. As the critical mass of city decision- and policy-makers that is better aware of the sub-surface and its sustainable use expands, the potential for higher level policy consideration of the subsurface grows, and a wider range of impacts will become achievable.},

The results demonstrate the overall significance of the cross-correlation based on the analysis of a statistic. Multifractality exists in cross-correlations, and the cross-correlated behavior of small fluctuations is more persistent than that of large fluctuations. Moreover, using the rolling windows method, we find that the cross-correlations between the Chinese exchange market and stock market vary with time and are especially sensitive to the reform of the RMB exchange rate regime. The previous reduction in the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate in July 2008 strengthened the persistence of cross-correlations and decreased the degree of multifractality, whereas the enhancement of the flexibility of the RMB exchange rate in June 2010 weakened the persistence of cross-correlations and increased the multifractality. Finally, several relevant discussions are provided to verify the robustness of our empirical analysis.},

A velocity prediction method via meta learning is proposed, which provides an adaptive and generative framework for multiple-driving cycles. The prediction model is devised using a deep neural network structure. The model's training is performed by the recently proposed meta-supervised learning, which ensures that one trained model could meet the adaptability to multiple driving cycles. The complete framework consists of three parts: Pre-training, fine-tune-training and real-time prediction, which is tested to predict the hybrid electric city buses' future velocity in a variable traffic scenario. The average prediction accuracy of 3, 5 and 10 s horizons is 0.51, 0.63 and 0.88~m s-1, which is 25.9\%, 16.78\% and 7.47\% higher than that trained by the conventional supervised learning method. As suggested, the proposed prediction method is effective and could meet the requirement of energy-saving control for hybrid electric city buses.

It will be the generalization of the correlation between pairwise time series and can be used to measure the multivariate correlation between the dependent variable y with the others i independent variable x. To validate the DMMC method, we determined the DMMC coefficient into numerical simulations on the standard Gaussian distribution, Lognormal distribution t distribution and ARFIMA long memory random sequences. Then we apply the proposed method to explore the multiple correlations between China's Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Hong Kong stock markets and analyze the dynamic time-varying characteristics of the correlation with the sliding window approach.

If the generating system has nonlinear dynamics, we may be able to construct a model that reproduces the dynamics and can be used for control and other purposes. In principle, multivariate time series are not necessary for recovering dynamics: according to the embedding theorem, only one time series should be needed. However, for real data, there may be large gains in using all of the measurements. In this paper we examine the issues of how to use multiple data streams most effectively for modeling and prediction. For example, perhaps the data are redundant in that only a subset of the data streams is useful. And how should we embed the data, if indeed embedding is required at all? We show how these questions can be answered, and describe some numerical experiments which show that using multivariate time series can significantlyimprove predictability.We also demonstrate a somewhat surprising synchronization between different reconstructions. {\copyright} 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Cities are becoming increasingly complex to manage, as they increase in size and must provide higher living standards for their populations. New technology-based solutions must be developed towards attending this growth and ensuring that it is socially sustainable. This paper puts forward the notion that these solutions must share some properties: they should be anthropocentric, holistic, horizontal, multi-dimensional, multi-modal, and predictive. We propose an architecture in which streaming data sources that characterize the city context are used to feed a real-time graph of the city's assets and states, as well as to train predictive models that hint into near future states of the city. This allows human decision-makers and automated services to take decisions, both for the present and for the future. To achieve this, multiple data sources about a city were gradually connected to a message broker, that enables increasingly rich decision-support. Results show that it is possible to predict future states of a city, in aspects such as traffic, air pollution, and other ambient variables. The key innovative aspect of this work is that, as opposed to the majority of existing approaches which focus on a real-time view of the city, we also provide insights into the near-future state of the city, thus allowing city services to plan ahead and adapt accordingly. The main goal is to optimize decision-making by anticipating future states of the city and make decisions accordingly.},

  abstract = {The objective of the present work was to integrate the urban sustainability indicators by multicriteria approach using Commitment Programming (CP), which is based on Pressure-State-Response model, aiming to evaluate the intervention potential of socioeconomic, environmental and politics factors into the urbanization process. Such approach was applied to the north-northwest region of Campinas, SP, city by using Pressure (land use, urban growth and population density), State (green areas, urban equipment and social vulnerability) and Response (zoning plan 2004 and zoning plan 2018) components for modeling in GIS applying CP multicriteria method. It was observed that {$\sim$}49\% of the analyzed area had a good indicative of sustainability, which was reduced till {$\sim$}29\% with the implementation of the 2018 zoning plan. The exclusion of conservation areas is probably the determining factor for this reduction, as evidenced by pressure indicators on the Mata de Santa Genebra conservation unit and dendritic growth in the periurban areas. However, it should be noted that the evaluation encompassed the initial stage of zoning plan 2018, and a conclusive analysis of the environmental changes from the development was premature. Thus, it is recommended that this sustainability evaluation be a permanent tool to the analysis the actions of planning and management of urban land use.},

  abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) is the digital representation of physical and functional characteristics (such as geometry, spatial relationship, and geographic information) of a facility to support decisions during its life cycle. BIM has been extended beyond 3D geometrical representations in recent years, and now includes time as a fourth dimension and cost as a fifth dimension, as well as such other applications as virtual reality and augmented reality. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been increasingly applied in various products (smart homes, wearables) to enhance work productivity, living comfort, and entertainment. However, research addressing the integration of these two technologies (BIM and IoT) is still very limited, and has focused exclusively on the automatic transmission of sensor information to BIM models. This paper describes an attempt to represent and visualize sensor data in BIM with multiple perspectives in order to support complex decisions requiring interdisciplinary information. The study uses a university campus as an example and includes several scenarios, such as an auditorium with a dispersed audience and energy-saving options for rooms with different functions (mechanical/electrical equipment, classrooms, and laboratory). This paper also discusses the design of a common platform allowing communication among sensors with different protocols (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), the use of Dynamo to accept sensor data as input and automatically redraw visualized information in BIM, and how visualization may help in making energy-saving management decisions. {\copyright} 2018 by the authors.},

From the calculated power law scaling exponents we observe the volume and price-volume change time series possess strong anti-persistent behaviour. The price change of different time series shows persistent, stochastic and anti-persistent behaviour. We also observe the existence of multifractal characteristics in all price, volume and price-volume change time series.

The autocorrelation and cross correlation of the stride-interval fluctuations between the left foot and the right foot were studied. The results obtained reflect the fact that the degree of multifractality (W) and the degree of correlation ({$\gamma$}) are greater for the Control group compared to the diseased group. It is evident that the gait pattern of an individual becomes less steady and temporarily more disorganized in neural diseases due to the neuronal deterioration. The results obtained from the autocorrelation study for the left and the right foot are almost identical. It was also observed that the study of the autocorrelation is not always enough to distinguish between the Controlled and the diseased group. The study of the cross correlation between the left and the right foot can then help to recognize the diseased group. The present analysis shows that the cross correlation between the stride-interval fluctuations between the left and the right foot was greater for the healthy individuals compared to the patients with neurodegenerative disease.},

The two time series selected for the present analysis are both inherently non-linear and a very efficient non-linear technique Multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis (MF-DXA) has been applied. The basic idea behind this analysis has originated from the fact that weather conditions affect the moods and emotional states of an individual which influence the decision taking ability of an individual. The psychologists over the years from their researches and experiences have observed that the human psychology is possibly influenced by the weather conditions. In this regard, several research works have been performed to explore the influence of the different weather variables like, temperature, cloud cover, rain, humidity, wind speed on the moods of the investors which in turn affect the rise and fall of the stock returns. With this in view, the influence of global warming in terms of the global temperature anomalies on the fluctuations of the SENSEX values of India has been examined. The observed positive values of the global temperature anomalies is a clear manifestation of the Global warming. The SENSEX or the Sensitive Index is regarded as the prime indicator of the Indian Stock Market which correctly gauges the performances of the Indian Stock Market. The result obtained shows that the value of the cross correlation coefficient is {$\gamma$}X= -0.46 {\textpm} 0.01, which confirms the fact that the two time series are strongly cross correlated.},

The study includes the feasibility of using machine learning algorithms with different feature extraction and representation models for the identification of traffic incidents from the Twitter interactions. The comprehensive proposed approach is the combination of following four steps. In the first phase, a dictionary of traffic-related keywords is formed. Secondly, real-time Twitter data has been collected using the dictionary of identified traffic related keywords. In the third step, collected tweets have been pre-processed, and the feature generation model is applied to convert the dataset eligible for a machine learning classifier. Further, a machine learning model is trained and tested to identify the tweets containing traffic incidents. The results of the study show that machine learning models built on top of right feature extraction strategy is very promising to identify the tweets containing traffic incidents from micro-blogs.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a degenerative disorder of neural system that affects mainly the older population. Recently, many researches show that the EEG of AD patients can be characterized by EEG slowing, enhanced complexity of the EEG signals, and EEG synchrony. In order to examine the neural synchrony at multi scales, and to find a biomarker that help detecting AD in diagnosis, detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) of EEG signals is applied in this paper. Several parameters, namely DCCA coefficients in the whole brain, DCCA coefficients at a specific scale, maximum DCCA coefficient over the span of all time scales and the corresponding scale of such coefficients, were extracted to examine the synchronization, respectively. The results show that DCCA coefficients have a trend of increase as scale increases, and decreases as electrode distance increases. Comparing DCCA coefficients in AD patients with healthy controls, a decrease of synchronization in the whole brain, and a bigger scale corresponding to maximum correlation is discovered in AD patients. The change of max-correlation scale may relate to the slowing of oscillatory activities. Linear combination of max DCCA coefficient and max-correlation scale reaches a classification accuracy of 90},

  abstract = {Urban road intersection bottleneck has become an important factor in causing traffic delay and restricting traffic efficiency. It is essential to explore the prediction of the operating performance at intersections in real-time and formulate corresponding strategies to alleviate intersection delay. However, because of the sophisticated intersection traffic condition, it is difficult to capture the intersection traffic Spatio-temporal features by the traditional data and prediction methods. The development of big data technology and the deep learning model provides us a good chance to address this challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-task fusion deep learning (MFDL) model based on massive floating car data to effectively predict the passing time and speed at intersections over different estimation time granularity. Moreover, the grid model and the fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method are developed to identify the intersection area and derive a set of key Spatio-temporal traffic parameters from floating car data. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model, the floating car data from ten intersections of Beijing with a sampling rate of 3s are adopted for the training and test process. The experiment result shows that the MFDL model ena-bles us to capture the Spatio-temporal and topology feature of the traffic state efficiently. Compared with the traditional prediction method, the proposed model has the best prediction performance. The interplay between these two targeted prediction variables can significantly improve prediction accuracy and efficiency. Thereby, this method predicts the intersection operation performance in real-time and can provide valuable insights for traffic managers to improve the intersection's operation efficiency.},

Our approach takes account of studies related to navigation in physical environ- ments as well as information navigation in electronic media. Results of studies from the physical environment and electronic media reveal that 1) people exhibit similar cognitive behaviors (spatial cognition and the use of spatial knowledge) while navigating in physical and information spaces; and 2) the information space lacks legibility and imageability.

The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model.

  abstract = {Architectural prototyping is the process of using executable code to investigate stakeholders' software architecture concerns with respect to a system under development. Previous work has established this as a useful and cost-effective way of exploration and learning of the design space of a system and in addressing issues regarding quality attributes, architectural risks, and the problem of knowledge transfer and conformance. However, the actual industrial use of architectural prototyping has not been thoroughly researched so far. In this article, we report from three studies of architectural prototyping in practice. First, we report findings from an ethnographic study of practicing software architects. Secondly, we report from a focus group on architectural prototyping involving architects from four companies. And, thirdly, we report from a survey study of 20 practicing software architects and software developers. Our findings indicate that architectural prototyping plays an important and frequent role in resolving problems experimentally, but less so in exploring alternative solutions. Furthermore, architectural prototypes include end-user or business related functionality rather than purely architectural functionality. Based on these observations we provide recommendations for effective industrial architectural prototyping.},

The research has been performed in order to verify, using both the time and frequency domains time series analyses, if economic agents' long term decisions on outward foreign direct investments, leading to cross-border value chains and production fragmentation processes, are of adaptive or predictive character. Consequently, the aim was to check if the home country's economic growth leads the internationalization processes of domestic enterprises, which stays in line with Dunning's Investment Development Path (IDP) paradigm, or if these complex processes, thanks to entrepreneurs' ability to formulate relevant rational expectations, precede the home country's economic growth, which would be supported with the introduction of the policy on reinforcing the internationalization processes of domestic enterprises. The presence of the unidirectional economic growth-led internationalization, consistent with the IDP concept's base assumptions, has been ascertained by the results of the short term Granger causality tests. Nevertheless, the results of the wavelet analyses, supported with the results of the econometric block exogeneity long term causality Wald tests, have revealed that in the long term the OFDI stocks' growth permanently precedes the home country's economic growth, which stays in the unequivocal contrast with the IDP paradigm's premises, as well as with the indicated above short term Granger causality tests' outcomes and indicates that economic agents' choices are not strictly of adaptive but also of predictive character, which influences the current state of knowledge on economic complex systems' characteristics. Such a result is of a great importance in the light of the existence of the significant and still unexploited internationalization potential of Polish enterprises.},

Given that traditional backcasting are based on the classical cross-correlation function assuming two stationary time series, assumptions based on two non-stationary time series need a new approach. Thus, Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) provides a fanned estimator for a correlation between two non-stationary time series, providing then the stationary time series. Therefore, we developed a backcaster estimator and a predictor for the obtained stationary time series. The practical example of a Chilean cement production time series (1991--2015) illustrates our results.},

Moreover, Jensen-DCC function is also considered for H{\'e}non and Logistic chaotic maps for simulated time series. Then we considered a stock market time series dataset for the study of similarity of Latin American indexes with S\&P500 and Shanghai ones.

The same technique is also used to solve optimization problems of piezolaminated plate structures where the discrete design variables are the ply orientation angles of orthotropic layers. The implemented scheme helps to recover from the premature convergence to a local optimum, without the need of reinitiating the optimal design process, as it is the case of the gradient-based methods with continuous design variables. To show the performance of the proposed optimization methods, two illustrative and simple examples are presented and discussed.},

Secondly,. although it may ``count'' correctly, it may still fail to be rigid if it is set up with some special relative positions of its nodes and bars; This second type of failure is a question not of topology but of projective geometry.},

The DMCx2 is a measure of total association between the dependent variable, Y, with other p independent variables, X all with the same length N. DMCx2 is based on the generalization of the {$\rho$}(Xi,Xj) cross-correlation coefficient. With this methodology, it is possible to evaluate the statistical significance of DMCx2 for different levels confidence. Findings on this research show that rejection or non-rejection of the null hypothesis of DMCx2 also depends on the size N of the series and the time scale n evaluated. Our findings also show a behavior pattern in the critical values of DMCx2. Fixing the size of the series (N), as the size of the time scale n increases, the critical values tend to increase.},

However, issues of adoption and implementation persist, particularly for on-site use of BIM tools in the construction phase. We describe an empirical case-study of the implementation of an innovative `Site BIM' system on a major hospital construction project. The main contractor on the project developed BIM-enabled tools to allow site workers using mobile tablet personal computers to access design information and to capture work quality and progress data on-site. Accounts show that `Site BIM', while judged to be successful and actively supporting users, was delivered through an exploratory and emergent development process of informal prototyping. Technical IT skills were adopted into the construction project through personal relationships and arrangements rather than formal processes. Implementation was driven by construction project employees rather than controlled centrally by the corporate IT function.},

  title = {Modelled on {{Software Engineering}} : {{Flexible Parametric Models}} in the {{Practice}} of {{Architecture}}},
  author = {Davis, Daniel},
  year = {2013},
  journal = {Ph.D Thesis},
  number = {February},
  abstract = {In this thesis I consider the relationship between the design of software and the design of flexible parametric models. There is growing evidence that parametric models employed in practice lack the flexibility to accommodate certain design changes. When a designer attempts to change a model's geometry (by modifying the model's underlying functions and parameters) they occasionally end up breaking the model. The designer is then left with a dilemma: spend time building a new model, or abandon the changes and revise the old model. Similar dilemmas exist in software engineering. Despite these shared concerns, Robert Woodbury (2010, 66) states that there is currently ``little explicit connection'' between the practice of software engineering and the practice of parametric modelling. In this thesis I consider, using a reflective practice methodology, how software engineering may inform parametric modelling. Across three case studies I take aspects of the software engineering body of knowledge (language paradigms; structured programming; and interactive programming) and apply them to the design of parametric models for the Sagrada Fam{\'i}lia, the Dermoid pavilion, and the Responsive Acoustic Surface. In doing so I establish three new parametric modelling methods. The contribution of this research is to show there are connections between the practice of software engineering and the practice of parametric modelling. These include the following: {$\bullet$} Shared challenges: Both practices involve unexpected changes occurring within the rigid logic of computation. {$\bullet$} Shared research methods: Research methods from software engineering apply to the study of parametric modelling. {$\bullet$} Shared practices: The software engineering body of knowledge seems to offer a proven pathway for improving the practice of parametric modelling. These connections signal that software engineering is an underrepresented and important precedent for architects using parametric models; a finding that has implications for how parametric modelling is taught, how parametric models are integrated with practice, and for how researchers study and discuss parametric modelling.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we analyze empirical data, accounting for coordination processes between complex systems (bimanual coordination, interpersonal coordination, and synchronization with a fractal metronome), by using a recently proposed method: detrended crosscorrelation analysis (DCCA). This work is motivated by the strong anticipation hypothesis, which supposes that coordination between complex systems is not achieved on the basis of local adaptations (i.e., correction, predictions), but results from a more global matching of complexity properties. Indeed, recent experiments have evidenced a very close correlation between the scaling properties of the series produced by two coordinated systems, despite a quite weak local synchronization. We hypothesized that strong anticipation should result in the presence of long-range cross-correlations between the series produced by the two systems. Results allow a detailed analysis of the effects of coordination on the fluctuations of the series produced by the two systems. In the long term, series tend to present similar scaling properties, with clear evidence of long-range cross-correlation. Short-term results strongly depend on the nature of the task. Simulation studies allow disentangling the respective effects of noise and short-term coupling processes on DCCA results, and suggest that the matching of long-term fluctuations could be the result of short-term coupling processes.},

These emergent attributes can derive from large-scale relationships, connections, and interactive behavior despite not being apparent from their isolated components. It is possible to better comprehend complex systems by analyzing cross-correlations between time series. However, the accumulation of non-linear processes induces multiscale structures, therefore, a spectrum of power-law exponents (the fractal dimension) and distinct cyclical patterns. We propose the Multifractal detrended cross-correlation heatmaps (MF-DCCHM) based on the DCCA cross-correlation coefficients with sliding boxes, a systematic approach capable of mapping the relationships between fluctuations of signals on different scales and regimes. The MF-DCCHM uses the integrated series of magnitudes, sliding boxes with sizes of up to 5\% of the entire series, and an average of DCCA coefficients on top of the heatmaps for the local analysis. The heatmaps have shown the same cyclical frequencies from the spectral analysis across different multifractal regimes. Our dataset is composed of sales and inventory from the Brazilian automotive sector and macroeconomic descriptors, namely the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, Nominal Exchange Rate (NER), and the Nominal Interest Rate (NIR) from the Central Bank of Brazil. Our results indicate cross-correlated patterns that can be directly compared with the power-law spectra for multiple regimes. We have also identified cyclical patterns of high intensities that coincide with the Brazilian presidential elections. The MF-DCCHM uncovers non-explicit cyclic patterns, quantifies the relations of two non-stationary signals (noise effect removed), and has outstanding potential for mapping cross-regime patterns in multiple domains.},

In doing so, this process generates a modern construction model which is fundamentally rooted in synthesizing streams of information into a set of useable outputs. This process differs fundamentally from conventional parametric BIM modeling, which relies mostly on the manual placement of building elements in the context of either a large, or otherwise isolated 3D model. A specific process of team-based functional modeling is presented for creating an adaptable BIM model to preserve and generate design and construction data throughout the process, from early design stages through fabrication, assembly, and construction. A case study of Zaha Hadid Architects' City of Dreams casino project in Macau demonstrates the use of this process in a complex, real world application.},

The results obtained suggest that the markets are partially integrated in crisis and non-crisis periods. In addition, financial series do not present significant persistent long memories arising from the subprime crisis. The 2008 crisis was found to have a greater impact on the cross correlation coefficients of the Latin American stock markets than the dot-com crisis. In terms of conclusion, it is considered that the financial markets of Latin America were affected by the dot-com and subprime crises.

The results indicate that the principal components obtained by DMCA-based PCA are more reliable in small and medium scale range, and the new method is relatively immune to additive trend and non-stationarity. To further show the utility of DMCA-based PCA in natural complex systems, six air pollutants data collected in Beijing from December 2013 to November 2016 are investigated seasonally. We found that the pollutants PM2.5, PM10 and CO are the most important factors affecting air quality of Beijing, and O3 is the secondary contaminants among four seasons. The contributors to the principal components in winter are the most stable for all time scales, and the second are that in autumn.

  abstract = {We analyze correlations and cross-correlations in wind speed and solar radiation temporal series recorded at the Island Fernando de Noronha in northeastern Brazil, using Detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and Detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA). We find that both processes exhibit persistent long-term power law correlations as well as persistent long term cross correlations. The observed persistency is found to be stronger for wind speed then for solar radiation, as indicated by higher value of the scaling exponent. By applying DFA on sliding windows of 365 day duration, we find that persistency is preserved for these windows along the entire studied period. In the periods when the decrease in correlation exponent for wind speed is observed, solar radiation shows increased persistency (higher values of correlation exponent) indicating the existence of certain complementarity between persistence property of the two stochastic processes.},

The current goal is the development of an interactive system for generating solutions on the Web based on a modeling approach called discursive grammar. A discursive grammar consists of a programming grammar and a designing grammar. The programming grammar generates design briefs based on user data; the designing grammar provides the rules for generating designs in a particular style, and a set of heuristics guides the generation of designs towards a solution that matches the design brief. This paper describes the designing grammar using Siza's houses at Malagueira as a case study.},

  abstract = {Spatial allocation is the process of assigning different attributes (e.g., land-use or land-cover) to spatial entities (e.g., map polygons or grid cells). It is an exercise that often requires the analysis of multiple, sometimes conflicting, objectives. Multi-objective spatial allocation problems often exhibit substantial computational complexity, especially when spatial pattern characteristics are specified as the allocation objectives. Optimization techniques that incorporate heuristics or knowledge-informed rules have been found to be more effective in solving spatial allocation problem. In this article, we (1) develop and demonstrate a knowledge-informed Pareto simulated annealing approach to tackle specifically multi-objective allocation problems that consider spatial patterns as objectives and (2) determine whether the knowledge-informed approach is more effective than standard Pareto simulation annealing in solving multi-objective spatial allocation problems. Four multi-objective spatial allocation problems were formulated in a gridded two-dimensional discrete space to benchmark the performance of our knowledge-informed algorithms and a standard Pareto simulated annealing algorithm. These four problems, each with two objectives, represent all combinations of cases in which there are (1) conflicting or concordant objectives and (2) two pattern objectives or one pattern objective and one non-pattern objective, representing objectives with similar or different degrees of difficulty. We generated 1200 sets of solutions, represented as allocation maps. Performance indices that measure the computational effectiveness and efficiency were developed for evaluation. The results suggest that the solutions generated by the knowledge-informed approach are more effective in approximating the set of Pareto optimal solutions than those generated by the standard Pareto simulated annealing.},

We remarked that volume change series is anti-persistent when we analyzed the generalized Hurst exponent for all moments q. The cross-correlation test showed the presence of a significant cross-correlation. However, DCCA coefficient had a small positive value, which means that the level of correlation is not very significant.

This can help by reducing vehicle emissions in the most polluted road sections, optimizing the pollution levels while maximizing the vehicle flow. For this, we use data sets gathered from a set of air quality monitoring stations, embedded low-cost e-participatory pollution sensors, contextual data, and the road network available data. These data are used in the air quality indexes calculation and then the generation of a dynamic traffic network. This network is represented by a weighted graph in which the edges weights evolve according to the pollution indexes. In this paper, we propose to combine the benefits of agent technology with both machine learning and big data tools. An artificial neural networks model and the Dijkstra algorithm are used for air quality prediction and the least polluted path finding in the road network. All data processing tasks are performed over a Hadoop-based framework: HBase and MapReduce.},

Here, we introduce a new correlation coefficient which takes into account the lag difference of data points. We investigate the properties of this new correlation coefficient.

  abstract = {Context: Modern middleware platforms provide the applications deployed on top of them with facilities for their adaptation. However, the level of adaptation support provided by the state-of-the-art middleware solutions is often limited to dynamically loading and off-loading of software components. Therefore, it is left to the application developers to handle the details of change such that the system's consistency is not jeopardized. Objective: We aim to change the status quo by providing the middleware facilities necessary to ensure the consistency of software after adaptation. We would like these facilities to be reusable across different applications, such that the middleware can streamline the process of achieving safe adaptation. Method: Our approach addresses the current shortcomings by utilizing the information encoded in a software system's architectural style. This information drives the development of reusable adaptation patterns. The patterns specify both the exact sequence of changes and the time at which those changes need to occur. We use the patterns to provide advanced adaptation support on top of an existing architectural middleware platform. Results: Our experience shows the feasibility of deriving detailed adaptation patterns for several architectural styles. Applying the middleware to adapt two real-world software systems shows the approach is effective in consistently adapting these systems without jeopardizing their consistency. Conclusion: We conclude the approach is effective in alleviating the application developers from the responsibility of managing the adaptation process at the application-level. Moreover, we believe this study provides the foundation for changing the way adaptation support is realized in middleware solutions. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We present examples from practice in which our definition of the softBIM method has been used to some extent. We discuss its advantages and disadvantages in relation to its use in early project phases. The premise for this study is twofold; it has been our intention both to revise the way in which our tools are used, arriving at the back-end programming level in an attempt to increase effectiveness, as well as to devise a specific open-source-type methodology drawing on the above philosophy in a specific way inherent to the UNStudio existing software culture. The goal of this study is to propose an integrative, schematic, and open-ended model for dealing with complex assemblies of geometric and nongeometric project data, aiming to remain nonreliant on specific software packages.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the multiscale cross-correlations between electricity price and trading volume in Czech market based on a newly developed algorithm, called Multifractal Cross-Correlation Analysis (MFCCA). The new algorithm is a natural multifractal generalization of the Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA), and is sensitive to cross-correlation structure and free from limitations of other algorithms. By considering the original sign of the cross-covariance, it allows us to properly quantify and detect the subtle characteristics of two simultaneous recorded time series. First, the multifractality and the long range anti-persistent auto-correlations of price return and trading volume variation are confirmed using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (MF-DFA). Furthermore, we show that there exist long-range anti-persistent cross-correlations between price return and trading volume variation by MFCCA. And we also identify that the cross-correlations disappear on the level of relative small fluctuations. In order to obtain deeper insight into the dynamics of the electricity market, we analyze the relation between generalized Hurst exponent and the multifractal cross-correlation scaling exponent {$\lambda$}q. We find that the difference between the generalized Hurst exponent and the multifractal cross-correlation scaling exponent is significantly different for smaller fluctuation, which indicates that the multifractal character of cross-correlations resembles more each other for electricity price and trading volume on the level of large fluctuations and weakens for the smaller ones.},

Recently, the availability of massive trajectory data and the success of deep learning motivate a plethora of deep traffic prediction studies. However, the existing neural-network-based approaches tend to ignore the correlations between multiple types of moving objects located in the same spatio-temporal traffic area, which is suboptimal for traffic prediction analytics. In this paper, we propose a multi-source deep traffic prediction framework over spatio-temporal trajectory data, termed as MDTP. The framework includes two phases: spatio-temporal feature modeling and multi-source bridging. We present an enhanced graph convolutional network (GCN) model combined with long short-term memory network (LSTM) to capture the spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics of traffic in the feature modeling phase. In the multi-source bridging phase, we propose two methods, Sum and Concat, to connect the learned features from different trajectory data sources. Extensive experiments on two real-life datasets show that MDTP i) has superior efficiency, compared with classical time-series methods, machine learning methods, and state-of-the-art neural-network-based approaches; ii) offers a significant performance improvement over the single-source traffic prediction approach; and iii) performs traffic predictions in seconds even on tens of millions of trajectory data. we develop MDTP+, a user-friendly interactive system to demonstrate traffic prediction analysis.},

  abstract = {There are building systems, called "modularized", in which the component systems (for structure, lighting, etc) can be analyzed and synthesized independently since their performance and design do not interact or affect one another. There are other building systems, called "coupled", in which the component systems do interact and influence one another. The thesis acknowledges that in a building there are both sub-systems that act independently and others that interact. While many design processes have been proposed for dealing with discrete sub-systems, there is no systematic study for building sub-systems that interrelate. This thesis examines a different design approach called integrated. The term "integrated" has a dual utilization in this study. The first use refers to the integration of form and building performance. The second use refers to the integration of interrelated and diverse building performances involving multiple disciplines. The integrated design approach analyzes and evaluates several interrelated design systems involving different disciplines in the early design phase. The goal of the approach is the generation of design alternatives guided simultaneously by two basic objectives: the aspiration for form exploration and the satisfaction of the performances of interrelated systems. After defining a framework for an integrated design approach, which includes inter-disciplinary collaboration, unified design, optimization, simulation, and other formal and digital techniques, the approach will be demonstrated in a case study. The objective of the case study is to demonstrate that the integrated design approach has validity and can be realized, in this case, for the generation of high-rise buildings guided by structural, lighting, zoning codes, and aesthetic criteria.},

In this paper, a synchronous test system including high-speed camera and Laser Doppler Vibrometer (LDV) is established to analyze characteristics of cavitation-induced vibration on the runner of a bulb turbine under different cavitation states. The results show that the peak-to-peak and Root Mean Square (RMS) values of vibration velocities on the turbine runner both increase with the severity of cavitation, but the growth rate is remarkably different which strongly depends on the cavitation state. The runner vibration velocity holds a normal distribution for all cavitation states, and the variance of the normal distribution increases gradually with the severity of cavitation. The increase of cavitation level is accompanied by frequency band migration of vibration signals. In the state of complete cavitation, the local energy extreme of the medium-high frequency component of the runner vibration velocity signal migrates to the low frequency region, resulting in an obvious increase in the energy of the low frequency region.},

With this aim, we extend several concepts from univariate random functions and their increments to the bivariate case. Specifically, we introduce the bivariate cumulative range as well as the concepts of co-self-similar processes and random processes with co-affine increments of bivariate parameter. They allow us to introduce a new procedure, named multifractal cross-correlated fractal dimension (MFXFD) algorithm. We theoretically prove the validity of such a novel approach to calculate the bivariate Hurst exponent of a pair of processes with co-affine increments. Interestingly, that class of random functions is characterised theoretically in terms of co-self-similar processes. Moreover, we prove that a pair of univariate self-similar processes are co-self-similar and their bivariate Hurst exponent coincides with the mean of their univariate parameters. Finally, we test the behavior of the new algorithm to calculate the bivariate Hurst exponent of a pair of time series. Both DCCA and MFHXA procedures are involved in such an empirical comparison. Our results suggest that the new MFXFD performs (at least) as well as the other approaches with shorter deviations with respect to the mean of the bivariate Hurst exponents.},

While studying the Eurozone members could explain some problems in the common currency, studying the non-Euro countries is important to analyse if they are fit to take the possible benefits.

New-Zealand with H=0.457{\textpm}0.004 and Jordan with H=0.602{\textpm}0.006 are far from EMH. The nature of cross-correlation exponents based on AMF-DXA is almost multifractal for all pair of Stock markets. The empirical relation, Hxy{$\leq$}[Hxx+Hyy]/2, is confirmed. Mentioned relation for q{\textquestiondown}0 is also satisfied while for q{\textexclamdown}0 there is a deviation from this relation confirming behavior of markets for small fluctuations is affected by contribution of major pair. For larger fluctuations, the cross-correlation contains information from both local (internal) and global (external) conditions. Width of singularity spectrum for auto-correlation and cross-correlation are {$\Delta\alpha$}xx{$\in$}[0.304,0.905] and {$\Delta\alpha$}xy{$\in$}[0.246,1.178], respectively. The wide range of singularity spectrum for cross-correlation confirms that the bilateral relation between Stock markets is more complex. The value of {$\sigma$}DCCA indicates that all pairs of stock market studied in this time interval belong to cross-correlated processes.},

Retrieving information for 26 shares of firms producing renewable energy, in this paper we use the DCCA correlation coefficient to see how those shares behave with the main indices. If shares and indices are not correlated, different factors affect them, which could be seen as a possibility of risk diversification. The results show that in the short run correlation exists (in scales under 100 days) but in the long run most shares are uncorrelated with the indices of their countries (in scales greater than 200), meaning that those shares, associated with more sustainable principles, could be used to manage portfolio risks.},

  abstract = {The relationship between oil prices and stock markets is commonly studied, in order to understand how financial markets are influenced by this important real asset. The evidence of any kind of interdependence is important, because investors could have additional information about the evolution of those kinds of assets. In this paper, we analyse the detrended cross-correlation coefficient between oil price and 20 different stock markets. We split our sample, in order to analyse the behaviour of that correlation before and after the 2008 crisis, allowing us to use the {$\Delta$} {$\rho$}DCCA, searching for a possible increase in the connection between both variables. Based on the existing literature, which used simulated and real time series to define the critical values for {$\Delta$} {$\rho$}DCCA, we study the statistical significance of this variable Our results show some evidence that before the crisis the correlations were low, but increased after the crisis, which could be understood as an increase in the relationship between oil and stock markets. This is an interesting result because it shows that stock markets are now more exposed to oil price fluctuation than before the crisis.},

We consider the effect of trading volume (related with liquidity) on the dynamic dependence of time series, using data from the Portuguese stock market, with both listed and non-listed firms in the main index. We use detrended fluctuation analysis, with a sliding windows approach, to estimate the dynamic dependence of shares. We found two interesting and related features: firms listed in the main index have results more centred at the 0.5 level; exponents' volatility is less in the second half of the sample, after the most severe period of the Eurodebt crisis. Then, we relate this dependence with trading volume, with detrended cross-correlation analysis and the respective correlation coefficient. We found that for firms listed in the main index, some show evidence of negative correlations while for non-listed firms, most of the shares have the same results. We conclude that the lack of liquidity could be related to increased dependence. An interesting feature found is that some firms have a positive correlationship between the variables, but all those firms work with natural resources in their activities, which could mean that other factors influence their dependence patterns.},

Based on the Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis correlation coefficient, which allows us to analyse the impacts for different time scales, we conclude unsurprisingly that the most affected sectors are those most related with the use of oil. However, another important result is the significant correlation between oil price shocks and the returns of the financial sector, showing this particular sector's exposure to oil, i.e., this is one of the sectors most correlated with oil returns. This is relevant not only for investors but also for authorities, because possible future oil shocks could have a high impact on the Brazilian financial sector},

First, we have analysed a large dataset that is not standard in the topical applied papers. And second, the utilised methods have allowed us to focus on possible differences between the short-term and long-term relationships between the interest rate differentials and foreign exchange rates that form the parity. Overall, the evidence for the parity is scarce, which is in hand with most of the previous studies. However, we have also uncovered some interesting patterns in the results and we provide an additional discussion of possible causes and directions for future research.},

  abstract = {EEG is one of the techniques more used to assess the extent of damage from these deficiencies and even to find solutions such as rehabilitation or limb replacement using a bionic prosthesis, through brain-computer interface. That is why it is of vital importance that we understand the functioning of the primary motor cortex of the brain in the control of real/imaginary tasks. From Physionet database, with two-minute EEG recordings in three different experiments (real/imaginary), we applied DFA and DCCA methods to find auto-correlations and cross-correlations. DFA method was capable of quantitatively describing similarities when the brain performs the same motor task, and show there are three time-scales. After, in order to compare the fluctuation amplitude of an EEG signal in relation to the other channels and measure these cross-correlations, we applied {$\Delta$}logFDFA function and {$\rho$}DCCA coefficient. Thus, choosing the F3 channel (front) as the reference, we identified generally that: {$\Delta$}logFDFA[F3:xx]{$\geq$}0 and {$\rho$}DCCA{\textquestiondown}0. The channels: Cz, F6, T9, and T10, are those that have a higher level of DCCA cross-correlation, if compared to the channel F3. The time scale II, with 16{\textexclamdown}n{$\leq$}723, is the one with {$\rho$}DCCA maximum. Finally, the statistic applied in this paper, based on the DFA-method, proved to be an excellent candidate for studies of motor functions in the brain computer interface area.},

The first experiment involved resources of the Paracloud program and its relation with the Rhinoceros program, that resulted in the production of physical models produced with the aid of the laser cutting. In the second experiment, the students had produced algorithms in the Grasshopper, resulting in families of structures and coverings. The study objects are both the physical models and digital algorithms resultants from this experimentation. For the analysis and synthesis of the results, we adopted four important assumptions: 1. the value of attitudes and environment of work; 2. the importance of experimentation and improvisation; 3. understanding of the design process as a situated act and as a ill-defined problem; 4. the inclusion of creative and critical thought in the disciplines. The results allow us to affirm that the parametric modeling stimulates creativity, therefore allowing combination of different parameters, that result in unexpected discoveries.{\textbackslash}r{\textbackslash}nKeywords: Teach-Learning, Parametric Modeling, Laser Cutter, Grasshopper, Design Process, Creativity.},

  abstract = {The complexity of the industrial processes, large-scale plants and the massive use of distributed control systems and sensors are challenges which open ways for alternative monitoring systems. The decentralized monitoring methods are one option to deal with these complex challenges. These methods are based on process decomposition, i.e., dividing the plant variables into blocks, and building statistical data models for every block to perform local monitoring. After that, the local monitoring results are integrated through a decision fusion algorithm for a global output concerning the process. However, decentralized process monitoring has to deal with a critical issue: a proper process decomposition, or block division, using only available data. Knowledge of the plant is rarely available, so data-driven approaches can help to manage this issue. Moreover, this is the first and key step to developing decentralized monitoring models and several alternative approaches are available. In this work a comparative study is carried out regarding decentralized fault monitoring methods, comparing several alternative proposals for process decomposition based on data. These methods are based on information theory, regression and clustering, and are compared in terms of their monitoring performance. When the blocks are obtained, CVA (Canonical Variate Analysis) based local dynamic monitors are set up to characterize the local process behavior, while also considering the dynamic nature of the industrial plants. Finally, the Bayesian Inference Index (BII) is implemented, based on these local monitoring, to achieve a global outcome regarding fault detection for the whole process. To further compare their performance from the application viewpoint, the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, a well-known industrial benchmark, is used to illustrate the efficiencies of all the discussed methods. So, a systematically comparison have been carried out involving different data-driven methods for process decomposition to implement a decentralized monitoring scheme. The results are focused on providing a reference for practitioners as guidelines for successful decentralized monitoring strategies.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, legacy electrical distribution systems are migrating to a new modern electric grid with the capability of supporting different applications such as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), distributed energy resources, and electric vehicles. Among these applications, AMI is playing an important role in delivering data from customers to power utilities, supporting reliable real-time monitoring, and remote operation of power quality data and voltage profile. The AMI consists of smart meters, data aggregation points (DAPs), the utility control center, and communication networks. Appropriate network planning plays an essential role in facilitating the exchange of data between consumers and power utilities as well as accommodating new smart grid applications and future growth. This work proposes an optimal placement of DAPs for AMI based on machine learning clustering techniques in residential grids. Network partitioning is introduced to create sub-networks and graph algorithms generate a deployment topology given optimization constraints. A new measurement metric called coverage density is considered to indicate neighborhood area networks (NAN) zones with the appropriate coverage. Three real scenarios of NAN are considered: urban, suburban, and rural.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new algorithm called multi-objective genetic programming (MOGP) for complex civil engineering systems. The proposed technique effectively combines the model structure selection ability of a standard genetic programming with the parameter estimation power of classical regression, and it simultaneously optimizes both the complexity and goodness-of-fit in a system through a non-dominated sorting algorithm. The performance of MOGP is illustrated by modeling a complex civil engineering problem: the time-dependent total creep of concrete. A Big Data is used for the model development so that the proposed concrete creep model---referred to as a ``genetic programming based creep model'' or ``G-C model'' in this study---is valid for both normal and high strength concrete with a wide range of structural properties. The G-C model is then compared with currently accepted creep prediction models. The G-C model obtained by MOGP is simple, straightforward to use, and provides more accurate predictions than other prediction models.}

Comput., in press], a Local Fourier Analysis (LFA) for multigrid methods with standard coarsening on triangular grids has been proposed. It is based on an expression of the Fourier transform in new coordinate systems. LFA is applied to the new coarsening strategy to design components for an efficient multigrid algorithm. The definition of low and high frequencies, and therefore the spaces of harmonics, are adapted according to the new situation. Appropriate smoothing methods, in particular a three-color smoother with optimal relaxation parameter, are proposed and analyzed for the discrete Laplace operator obtained with linear finite elements. Moreover, special inter-grid transfer operators are designed. These methods are compared with standard coarsening algorithms in terms of the computational work required. Independently of the shape of the triangles, we show that the three-coarsening strategy is a good computational alternative to standard coarsening.},

The authors, experienced in teaching tools and BIM processes, point to a lack of grounding in this type of evaluation. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an approach. The aim was to establish methodology to verify which of the most used BIM software worldwide qualify as being able to create parametric objects. The proposed method is a matrix that describes the features offered by a binary tool/software (system) to carry out activities related to parametric objects, according to the definitions established by several BIM researchers. To test the matrix, a typical parametric ``Door'' object was chosen. The results showed that the features offered by the systems vary widely. It was possible to establish an index, called BIM Object Parametrization Index, that can be subdivided into other indicators. The method allowed to establish rules for evaluate systems for their ability to deal with BIM objects according to defined criteria; it is recommended, that more research is done from this foundation, so as to improve the quality of information on this issues for the community.},

To demonstrate the advantages of this method, we analyze multifractal binomial measures contaminated with strong white noises and compare the performance of MM-DPXA method to traditional cross-correlation techniques. It is found that MM-DPXA method can not only eliminate the influence of other variables, but also provide more valuable information from multiscale perspective. Moreover, this method is able to characterize monofractality or multifractality of the time series in a wide range of scales simultaneously and without assuming any presumed time scale. To further show the utility of MM-DPXA method in complex systems, we provide new evidence on the financial time series. By comparing Hurst surfaces before and after removing common influences, we conclude that cross-correlations and intrinsic cross-correlations show different properties in different scales. Furthermore, we also study the effect of financial crisis on the cross-correlations between Chinese and American stock markets using MF-DCCA and MF-DPXA methods.},

The main mechanism of this paper is to use the invariance of the nonlinear monotonic transformation and robustness in permutation mutual information (PMI), which solves the limitations of DCCA only applicable to linear measurements and enhances the robustness of DPMI to noise. We compare the performance of DPMI with DCCA on multifractal binomial measures and H{\'e}non maps for testing the effectiveness of the new method. By analyzing EEG signals obtained from children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as well as healthy children, we demonstrate that DPMI surpasses DCCA in processing physiological signals. Furthermore, we conclude that DPMI is more effective in distinguishing between different states within distinct groups. Given that EEG signals in physiological systems are associated with other channel signals, we propose a method called partial DPMI (PDPMI) that combines partial-correlation technique with DPMI. PDPMI can further reveal the direct interactions between two considered signals by eliminating potential influences from other unconsidered signals. In summary, PDPMI serves as a complementary perspective to DPMI, enhancing our understanding in the interactive structure of physiological network.},

We utilized the multifractal detrending moving average cross-correlation analysis (MF-X-DMA) method to examine the multifractal features among data. We find that the cross-correlations between each pair of time series are significant by using the cross-correlation test statistic Qcc(m)''-analysis and detrended moving average cross-correlation analysis (DMCA) coefficient. Also, the cross-correlation coefficients {$\rho$}DMCA show that the data are positively correlated, but the degree of correlation has been elevated by increasing the window intervals v. The observed results obtained through the MF-X-DMA method infer the existence of multifractal cross-correlations on ten bivariate time series in the study and that the strength of multifractality between Ethereum and Ripple is the highest, followed by the strength of multifractality between WTI crude oil and Ethereum.},

This paper presents a methodology to assist design decisions regarding the building envelope shape considering its implications on energy performance. Basically, this methodology involves a flexible design system, to generate alternative envelope shape designs, with integrated energy simulation, to calculate the energy demand of each design. Shape grammars are particularly suitable to encode architectural design systems, given their ability to encode compositional design principles. Their downside is the complexity in developing computer implementations. This methodology converts a grammar into a parametric design system and is illustrated with an application to the grammar for Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie houses. {\copyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Background and objectives: The expansion of evidence-based practice across sectors has lead to an increasing variety of review types. However, the diversity of terminology used means that the full potential of these review types may be lost amongst a confusion of indistinct and misapplied terms. The objective of this study is to provide descriptive insight into the most common types of reviews, with illustrative examples from health and health information domains. Methods: Following scoping searches, an examination was made of the vocabulary associated with the literature of review and synthesis (literary warrant). A simple analytical framework - Search, AppraisaL, Synthesis and Analysis (SALSA) - was used to examine the main review types. Results: Fourteen review types and associated methodologies were analysed against the SALSA framework, illustrating the inputs and processes of each review type. A description of the key characteristics is given, together with perceived strengths and weaknesses. A limited number of review types are currently utilized within the health information domain. Conclusions: Few review types possess prescribed and explicit methodologies and many fall short of being mutually exclusive. Notwithstanding such limitations, this typology provides a valuable reference point for those commissioning, conducting, supporting or interpreting reviews, both within health information and the wider health care domain. {\copyright} 2009 Health Libraries Group.},

By using the DCCA cross-correlation coefficient, we find that, for the Shanghai stock market, the increase in the degree of market multifractality can lead to a lower degree of market efficiency before the equity division reforms, whereas it can result in a lower degree of market efficiency in the short-term and a higher degree of market efficiency in the long-term after the equity division reforms. This finding reflects the process of development of the Shanghai stock market and also provides strong evidence which supports Liu's argument that the increase in the degree of market complexity can improve the market efficiency Liu (2009) [1].},

This shows how long the singular value decomposition entropy predicts the stock market that extends Caraiani's result obtained in Caraiani (2014).

However, after China became the world's second largest economy, the chaos of China's EPU has increased, while that of the US has decreased; The nonlinear correlation of EPU between China and the global has increased significantly, while that between the US and the global has decreased significantly; There is a significant interaction of EPU index between China and the global, while the EPU index of the US is no longer affected by the global.

Focusing on behavior big data mining and big data application in urban studies and planning practices, the review is proposed from four parts, involving behavior data acquisition \& analysis, spatial analysis, plan making \& management application and new methodologies with big data. Lastly, some open research issues such as potential challenges and possible directions of development are discussed.},

The resulting found geometry consists of purely axial forces under self-weight, with zero bending moment at nodes for both shells and tension net forms. The advantages of this method over known approaches are discussed, with an application on a recent live project also described. A real-time solver using semi-implicit Euler integration with viscous damping is used to achieve system equilibrium. By using a real-time solver, the designer is able to alter the gravitational field or apply new point loads without re-starting the analysis, leading to a interactive experience in generating design options. The successful application of the method on a recent project is also discussed.},

However, as the graph increases in complexity it quickly becomes inflexible and unsuitable for exploring a wide design space. By contrast, implicit low-level rule systems can offer wide design exploration due to their lack of structure, but often act as black boxes to human observers with only initial conditions and final designs cognisable. In response to these two extremes, the authors propose a new approach called Meta-Parametric Design, combining graph-based parametric modelling with genetic programming. The advantages of this approach are demonstrated using two real case-study projects that widen design exploration whilst maintaining the benefits of a graph representation.},

The analysis has commonly been done offline with the signal being resident in memory in full length, and the processing carried out in several distinct passes. However, in many relevant applications, such as monitoring or forecasting, algorithms are needed to capture changes in the fractal measure real-time. Here we introduce real-time variants of the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) and the closely related Signal Summation Conversion (SSC) methods, which are suitable to estimate the fractal exponent in one pass. Compared to offline algorithms, the precision is the same, the memory requirement is significantly lower, and the execution time depends on the same factors but with different rates. Our tests show that dynamic changes in the fractal parameter can be efficiently detected. We demonstrate the applicability of our real-time methods on signals of cerebral hemodynamics acquired during open-heart surgery.},

Big data offer the potential for cities to obtain valuable insights from a large amount of data collected through various sources, and the IoT allows the integration of sensors, radio-frequency identification, and Bluetooth in the real-world environment using highly networked services. The combination of the IoT and big data is an unexplored research area that has brought new and interesting challenges for achieving the goal of future smart cities. These new challenges focus primarily on problems related to business and technology that enable cities to actualize the vision, principles, and requirements of the applications of smart cities by realizing the main smart environment characteristics. In this paper, we describe the state-of-the-art communication technologies and smart-based applications used within the context of smart cities. The visions of big data analytics to support smart cities are discussed by focusing on how big data can fundamentally change urban populations at different levels. Moreover, a future business model of big data for smart cities is proposed, and the business and technological research challenges are identified.

Most studies investigating individuals' use of digitization have neglected the effects of the physical built environment and the daily life of the community. Addressing this gap, this paper places digital practices in the socio-spatial world, and conceptualizes the term ``urban digital lifestyle,'' which refers to the dynamic relationships among three dimensions: (1) the user's socioeconomic status, (2) the user's residency, with a focus on the locale's socio-spatial characteristics, and (3) the user's digital practices. Empirically, this paper uses a mixture of methods to analyze the digital usage of residents in four neighborhoods in Tel Aviv. The methods used are neighborhood prototype analysis, digital practices survey (n = 490), and spatial and GIS analyses. Although the results may at first glance support the argument that education and socioeconomic status have significant influence on digital practices, these practices also reflect many other factors associated with the urban lifestyle. Thus, locales, places and neighborhoods remain crucial socio-spatial categories that have a major influence on daily life in the digital age.},

Hence, in this study, we apply detrended cross-correlation analysis to investigate the multifractal properties between ozone and its precursors in a rural area in Hong Kong. The observed databases of ozone, NO2, NOx and CO levels during 2005--2014 are obtained from a rural monitoring station in Hong Kong. Based on the collected database, the cross-correlation analysis is carried out firstly to examine the cross-correlation patterns and the results indicate that close interactive relations exist between them. Then the detrended cross-correlation analysis is performed for further analysis. The multifractal characters occur between ozone and its precursors. The long-term cross-correlations behaviors in winter are verified to be stronger than that in other seasons. Additionally, the method is extended on daily averaged data to explore the multifractal property on various time scales. The long-term cross-correlation behavior of ozone vs NO2 and NOx on daily basis becomes weaker while that of ozone vs CO becomes stronger. The multifractal properties for all pairs in summer are found to be the strongest among the whole year. These findings successfully illustrate that the multifractal analysis is a useful tool for describing the temporal scaling behaviors of ozone trends in different time series in rural areas.},

In contrast to humidity and wind speed, the long-term cross-correlation behaviors between temperature with pollutants are found to be more evident in both urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the difference of multifractal property for varied pollutants is explored. The strengths of multifractal spectra between meteorological factors with PM10 are strongest while the corresponding values between meteorological factors with SO2 are weakest.

The governments around the world and others are aiming to guide and standardise this process by developing an array of standards to support this digitalisation, most notably on Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Smart Cities Framework. Furthermore, the advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT) is creating a highly flexible, dynamic and accessible platform for the exchange capture and of information. There is a risk that this information on the built environment is quickly becoming unmanageable, and the value of that information is quickly becoming lost. This paper presents a smart asset alignment framework that creates an alignment between the information captured at the infrastructure asset level and citizen requirements within a Smart City framework. The framework contributes to the debate on designing and developing Smart City solutions in a way that will deliver value to the citizens.}

In order to compare the performance of DMCA and DCCA in the detection of cross-correlation, and to estimate the influence of periodic trend, we generate two cross-correlated time series x(i) and y(i) by a periodic two-component fractionally autoregressive integrated moving average (ARFIMA) process. Then we apply both methods to quantify the cross-correlations of the generated series, whose theoretical values are already known to us. By comparing the results we obtained, we find that the performance of this new approach is comparable to DCCA with less calculating amounts; our method can also reduce the impact of trends; furthermore, DMCA (for background and forward moving average case) outperforms DCCA in more accurate estimation when the analyzed times series are short in length. To provide an example, we also apply this new method to the time series of the real-world data from Brent and WTI crude oil spot markets, to investigate the complex cross-market correlation between these commodity markets. In all, our method is another practical choice to detect the cross-correlation between two short period nonstationary time series, and has potential application to real world problems.},

Previous applications of cellular automata to architectural design have oftentimes been characterised by their limited generative capacity for top--down developmental control and for pragmatic rule-breaking as they are easily offered by human designers. This paper explores different options for modifying and extending classical cellular automata systems to support architectural form finding. It discusses the potential of cellular automata as generative design tools with respect to the questions: In which part of a design development, during which periods during a design process and in what roles do cellular automata promise desirable results from a practical standpoint? In response to these questions, a theoretical framework for the integration of cellular automata into the design process is presented. An implementation of a dialogue-based cellular automata-supported design process model is outlined and evaluated by remodelling an existing architectural design project.},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient-based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O(1). Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

  abstract = {Most empirical literature investigates the relation between oil prices and exchange rate through different models. These models measure this relationship on two time scales (long and short terms), and often fail to observe the co-movement of these variables at different time scales. We apply a detrended cross-correlation approach (DCCA) to investigate the co-movements of the oil price and exchange rate in 12 Asian countries. This model determines the co-movements of oil price and exchange rate at different time scale. The exchange rate and oil price time series indicate unit root problem. Their correlation and cross-correlation are very difficult to measure. The result becomes spurious when periodic trend or unit root problem occurs in these time series. This approach measures the possible cross-correlation at different time scale and controlling the unit root problem. Our empirical results support the co-movements of oil prices and exchange rate. Our results support a weak negative cross-correlation between oil price and exchange rate for most Asian countries included in our sample. The results have important monetary, fiscal, inflationary, and trade policy implications for these countries.},

  abstract = {Identifying current and future informal regions within cities remains a crucial issue for policymakers and governments in developing countries. The delineation process of identifying such regions in cities requires a lot of resources. While there are various studies that identify informal settlements based on satellite image classification, relying on both supervised or unsupervised machine learning approaches, these models either require multiple input data to function or need further development with regards to precision. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for identifying and informal settlements using street intersection data. With such minimal input data, we attempt to provide planners and policy-makers with a pragmatic tool that can aid in identifying informal zones in cities. The algorithm of the model is based on spatial statistics and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The proposed model relies on defining informal settlements based on two ubiquitous characteristics of informal settlements. We applied the model in five major cities in Egypt and India that have spatial structures in which informality is present. These cities are Greater Cairo, Alexandria, Hurghada and Minya in Egypt, and Mumbai in India. The predictSLUMS model shows high validity and accuracy for identifying and predicting informality within the same city the model was trained on or in different ones of a similar context. To enable this model to be used as a pragmatic tool for future prediction or further research concerning informal settlements and slums, we have made the python code for the pre-trained ANN models of the five studied cities.},

This study aims to assess the impact of the conflict on crude oil and refined product prices globally by applying bivariate and multivariate different cross-correlation methods to evaluate the prices relations covering three periods, namely P0 (from February 2019 to February 2020, before Covid-19 pandemic and also before the Russia--Ukraine war), P1 (from February 2021 to February 2022, during the Covid-19 pandemic and before the Russia--Ukraine war) and P2 (from February 2022 to February 2023, during both the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia--Ukraine war). The results indicate a significant difference between P0 and the other periods (P1 and P2) for most bivariate pairs and multivariate groups. When comparing P1 and P2, there was predominantly no significant difference for Heating Oil - Brent Crude Oil pair but a significant difference for Gasoil - Brent Crude Oil, suggesting a higher impact of the war on European diesel prices compared to the US diesel. Moreover, the adopted methods highlight the differential impacts and contagion effects observed in different energy commodities, emphasizing the complexity and unique dynamics within each market.},

In particular, we propose that firms that target new market segments with an architectural innovation will tend to be more successful than those that target existing markets or innovate in component technology, even after controlling for all the competing predictors of survival. This paper advances the existing literature on innovation by tracing the main technical elements of a dominant design in the rigid disk drive industry over time, and provides a much more rigorous definition of the concept of a dominant design than we have had in the past. We find the notion of first-mover advantage is not applicable in the rigid disk drive industry. Instead, we propose the idea of an entry-window tightly linked to the emergence of the dominant product design as defined.},

BIMs emerged as a result of a push by the software companies, to tackle the problems of inefficient information exchange between different software and to enable true interoperability. In BIM approach most up-to-date an accurate models of a building are stored in shared central databases during the design and the construction of a project and at post-construction stages. GIS based city monitoring / city management applications require the fusion of information acquired from multiple resources, BIMs, City Models and Sensors. This paper focuses on providing a method for facilitating the GIS based fusion of information residing in digital building ``Models'' and information acquired from the city objects i.e. ``Things''. Once this information fusion is accomplished, many fields ranging from Emergency Response, Urban Surveillance, Urban Monitoring to Smart Buildings will have potential benefits.},

The approach is illustrated within the context of additive manufacturing of non-conformal cellular structures. The paper concludes that parametric design thinking that omits a definition of topological relationships risks brittleness and failure in later design stages while a consideration of topology can create enhanced and smarter solutions as it can modify parameters based on an accommodation of the design context.},

These open-cellular polymer micro-truss structures were formed from an interpenetrating array of self-propagating polymer waveguides. Compression experiments verified that the effective modulus scaled linearly with the measured relative density of the micro-trusses and was reliably predicted from a simple analytical model. However, the measured peak strength at initial truss member buckling was well below the values predicted from inelastic buckling theory, which was attributed to imperfections in the structure and the nonlinear compressive behavior of the solid polymer. In addition, a micro-truss structure was post cured at a higher temperature in an oxidizing environment which suppressed the tendency for truss members to prematurely buckle. The polymer modulus increased by approximately 40\% and the peak strength of the micro-truss structure nearly doubled to 5.9MPa.},

These structures had sub-millimeter size features and comprised a repeating octahedral-type unit cell designed to suppress bending in the truss members prior to initial failure. For a typical shear loading method, the experimentally measured shear moduli deviated from predicted values as the relative density decreased. However, the mechanical behavior changed when the shear loading condition was altered to distribute the load more uniformly between all truss members and the measured shear modulus was aligned with predicted values. The shear strength and total plateau strain of these structures were strongly dependent on the mode of failure and the uniformity with which the truss member failure was distributed through the thickness of the structure. Furthermore, plateau strains of up to 60\% were achieved when all truss members in compression buckled uniformly. Thermo-oxidation reaction of the polymer micro-truss structures caused an increase in the shear modulus and maximum shear strength (up to 2.9MPa), although oxidized structures fractured at the maximum shear strain.},

  abstract = {Systematic mapping was developed in social sciences in response to a lack of empirical data when answering questions using systematic review methods, and a need for a method to describe the literature across a broad subject of interest. Systematic mapping does not attempt to answer a specific question as do systematic reviews, but instead collates, describes and catalogues available evidence (e.g. primary, secondary, theoretical, economic) relating to a topic or question of interest. The included studies can be used to identify evidence for policy-relevant questions, knowledge gaps (to help direct future primary research) and knowledge clusters (sub-sets of evidence that may be suitable for secondary research, for example systematic review). Evidence synthesis in environmental sciences faces similar challenges to those found in social sciences. Here we describe the translation of systematic mapping methodology from social sciences for use in environmental sciences. We provide the first process-based methodology for systematic maps, describing the stages involved: establishing the review team and engaging stakeholders; setting the scope and question; setting inclusion criteria for studies; scoping stage; protocol development and publication; searching for evidence; screening evidence; coding; production of a systematic map database; critical appraisal (optional); describing and visualising the findings; report production and supporting information. We discuss the similarities and differences in methodology between systematic review and systematic mapping and provide guidance for those choosing which type of synthesis is most suitable for their requirements. Furthermore, we discuss the merits and uses of systematic mapping and make recommendations for improving this evolving methodology in environmental sciences.},

Indeed, the introduction of porosity significantly decreases the dielectric constant {$\kappa$}, but also affects the mechanical properties. However, both mechanical and dielectric performances are influenced by the pore arrangement and geometry that can thus be optimized for these two antagonist properties. A Finite Element study is conducted to quantify the influence of the arrangement and the geometry of the pores via a homogenization approach. The best architectures for ILD applications are deduced. Random arrangements as well as 3D cubic arrangements (simple, body-centered, face-centered) of monodisperse spherical pores have been considered. These arrangements are obtainable by sol-gel processing, a method that often induces a marked shrinkage of the films. This shrinkage modifies the original cubic arrangements which become orthorhombic and the pore shape which becomes ellipsoidal. The effect on the dielectric and elastic properties of these architectural changes due to the shrinkage has also been studied. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

(b) The singularity widths of all soy futures markets and the cross-correlations decrease during trade friction; whilst the generalized Hurst exponents of all series experience significant increases, especially for large fluctuations. (c) The finite-size effect and the fat-tailed probability distributions can explain the major decrease in multifractality. Comparing the period before, soy futures markets became less correlated, less multifractal and more persistent during this trade friction. The evidences suggest that as the tariff on soy was put into effect, investigators in two countries may take different hedging behaviors and be more risk averse.},

We then apply the detrended cross-correlation coefficient to overcome this complication and find evidence of a significant and negative relationship between current stock market returns and current market volatility. Additionally, we find the strength of the negative return-volatility relation is different for specific scales and is stronger in longer time horizon. We further investigate the presence of volatility feedback and leverage effects in international stock markets by examining the lead-lag relation between stock returns and volatility and confirm that the negative return-volatility relation seems to be return-driven (the leverage effect). Finally, we examine the dynamic behavior of the return-volatility relation by applying a rolling window approach and find that time-varying negative return-volatility relation is more likely to generate an asymmetric response with a greater effect when returns decline, which is the common characteristic of international stock markets.},

This task is an essential but crucial loop in future smart cities construction, which can be widely applied in urban traffic management, disaster monitoring and mobility analysis. In recent years, video-like spatial--temporal modelling has been the most common approach in many deep learning models. However, the video-like modelling approach cannot consider some latent region-wise correlations other than geographic spatial distance information. To overcome the limitation, we propose a novel neural network framework, Adaptive Dual-View WaveNet (ADVW-Net), for the urban spatial--temporal event prediction. By integrating the spatial representations from Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and that from adaptive Graph convolutional neural network (GCN), our proposed model can capture not only the geographic correlations but also some latent region-wise dependencies from the input data. In addition, the effective architecture, WaveNet, can be transferred to region-wise spatial--temporal prediction scenarios for long-range temporal dependencies learning. Experimental results on three urban datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model.},

Although many policies in China have been issued to promote construction waste management, unfortunately there is no significant effect, and the key is lack of a quantitative evaluation system and guidance on management level. Based on the domestic and foreign relevant experiences, this paper puts forward a new system to evaluate waste management performance in an architectural engineering project. Through research, main influence factors of construction waste management in our country are confirmed, namely: ``commitment of contractor's representative on site; collecting packed materials back by suppliers; minimizing rework in the construction phase; design and construction using standardized materials; and appointment of laborers solely for waste disposal''. Through four construction cases in the Pearl River Delta with the application of performance assessment model of waste management in architectural engineering projects, it is proved that the model can effectively measure the waste management performance in construction site, with clearer responsibilities and higher performance. Finally, it is suggested that our government should assess waste management performance in construction site pertinently, develop market assessment software actively, and promote the environmental sustainable development of architectural industry.},

This paper explores the price--volatility nexus in cryptocurrency markets and investigates the presence of asymmetric volatility effect between uptrend (bull) and downtrend (bear) regimes. The conventional GARCH-class models have shown that in cryptocurrency markets, asymmetric reactions of volatility to returns differ from those of other traditional financial assets. We address this issue from a viewpoint of fractal analysis, which can cover the nonlinear interactions and the self-similarity properties widely acknowledged in the field of econophysics. The asymmetric cross-correlations between price and volatility for Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Ripple (XRP), and Litecoin (LTC) during the period from June 1, 2016 to December 28, 2020 are investigated using the MF-ADCCA method and quantified via the asymmetric DCCA coefficient. The approaches take into account the nonlinearity and asymmetric multifractal scaling properties, providing new insights in investigating the relationships in a dynamical way. We find that cross-correlations are stronger in downtrend markets than in uptrend markets for maturing BTC and ETH. In contrast, for XRP and LTC, inverted reactions are present where cross-correlations are stronger in uptrend markets.},

We find that the asymmetric volatility phenomenon varies by scale and cryptocurrency, and the structure is time-varying. Contrary to what is typically observed in equity markets, minor currencies show an ``inverse'' asymmetric volatility effect at relatively large scales, where positive shocks (good news) have a greater impact on volatility than negative shocks (bad news). The consequences are discussed in the context of who is trading in the market and heterogeneity of the investors.},

By analyzing several examples we show that the new method can reliably determine the multifractal scaling behavior of time series.

  abstract = {Assessing power-law cross-correlations between a pair -- or among a set -- of processes is of great significance in diverse fields of analyses ranging from neuroscience to financial markets. In most cases such analyses are computationally expensive and thus carried out offline once the entire signal is obtained. However, many applications -- such as mental state monitoring or financial forecasting -- call for fast algorithms capable of estimating scale-free coupling in real time. Detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA), a generalization of the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to the bivariate domain, has been introduced as a method designed to quantify power-law cross-correlations between a pair of non-stationary signals. Later, in analogy with the Pearson cross-correlation coefficient, DCCA was adapted to the detrended cross-correlation coefficient (DCCC), however as of now no online algorithms were provided for either of these analysis techniques. Here we introduce a new formula for obtaining the scaling functions in real time for DCCA. Moreover, the formula can be generalized via matrix notation to obtain the scaling relationship between not only a pair of signals, but also all possible pairs among a set of signals at the same time. This includes parallel estimation of the DFA scaling function of each individual process as well, thus allowing also for real-time acquisition of DCCC. The proposed algorithm matches its offline variants in precision, while being substantially more efficient in terms of execution time. We demonstrate that the method can be utilized for mental state monitoring on multi-channel electroencephalographic recordings obtained in eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions.},

  abstract = {The phenomenon of increasing the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere over the years is known as the Global warming. The Global warming has several adverse effects on our climate, our health and our communities. The resulting climate changes due to global warming produce significant changes in the weather patterns. It is also argued that the climate changes occurring due to global warming is responsible for the various geological hazards occurring in the world, like earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis (Gutenberg and Richter, 1954; Turcotte and Schubert, 2002; Wu and Johnston, 2000; Wu and Hasegawa, 1996a; Wu and Hasegawa, 1996b; Wu, 1997). McGuire in his book (McGuire, 2012) has explained in detail the interlink between the climate changes occurring due to global warming and the occurrence of geological disasters like earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. Looking back to the past, when the climate changed naturally and our planet emerged from the ice age, the huge pressure exerted on the Earth's crust suddenly disappeared causing the Earth's crust to bounce back, the increased stress on the Earth's crust activated earthquakes, tremors and volcanic eruptions along the pre-existing fault lines. Currently, our planet, the Earth is still responding to the end of the last ice age some 20,000 or more years ago when the temperatures began to rise, huge masses of ice-sheets disappeared resulting from the melting of large masses of ice. Thus the rising temperature may be related to the anomalous emanation of soil radon-222 gas prior to an earthquake. The prime focus of this paper is to search for any cross correlation existing between the daily land-surface temperature anomalies and the soil radon concentration using a robust state of art method, Multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis (MF-DXA). The data sets for both the series used for the analysis are for a period from 2005 to 2014. The analysis shows that these two time series are not only cross correlated but having the cross correlation coefficient {$\gamma$}X=0.012{\textpm}0.01, which clearly indicates a strong correlation between the soil radon-222 anomalies and the daily land-surface temperature anomalies.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of mobile-internet technologies, on-demand ride-sourcing services have become increasingly popular and largely reshaped the way people travel. Demand prediction is one of the most fundamental components in supply-demand management systems of ride-sourcing platforms. With an accurate short-term prediction for origin-destination (OD) demand, the platforms make precise and timely decisions on real-time matching, idle vehicle reallocations, and ride-sharing vehicle routing, etc. Compared to the zone-based demand prediction that has been examined in many previous studies, OD-based demand prediction is more challenging. This is mainly due to the complicated spatial and temporal dependencies among the demand of different OD pairs. To overcome this challenge, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Encoder-Decoder Residual Multi-Graph Convolutional network (ST-ED-RMGC), a novel deep learning model for predicting ride-sourcing demand of various OD pairs. Firstly, the model constructs OD graphs, which utilize adjacent matrices to characterize the non-Euclidean pair-wise geographical and semantic correlations among different OD pairs. Secondly, based on the constructed graphs, a residual multi-graph convolutional (RMGC) network is designed to encode the contextual-aware spatial dependencies, and a long-short term memory (LSTM) network is used to encode the temporal dependencies, into a dense vector space. Finally, we reuse the RMGC networks to decode the compressed vector back to OD graphs and predict the future OD demand. Through extensive experiments on the for-hire-vehicles datasets in Manhattan, New York City, we show that our proposed deep learning framework outperforms the state-of-arts by a significant margin.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a scalable deep learning approach for short-term traffic prediction based on historical traffic data in a vehicular road network. Capturing the spatiooral relationship of the big data often requires a significant amount of computational burden or an ad-hoc design aiming for a specific type of road network. To tackle the problem, we combine a road network graph with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to construct a structural RNN (SRNN). The SRNN employs a spatiooral graph to infer the interaction between adjacent road segments as well as the temporal dynamics of the time series data. The model is scalable thanks to two key aspects. First, the proposed SRNN architecture is built by using the semantic similarity of the spatiooral dynamic interactions of all segments. Second, we design the architecture to deal with fixed-length tensors regardless of the graph topology. With the real traffic speed data measured in the city of Santander, we demonstrate the proposed SRNN outperforms the image-based approaches using the capsule network (CapsNet) by 14.1\% and the convolutional neural network (CNN) by 5.87\%, respectively, in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE). Moreover, we show that the proposed model is scalable. The SRNN model trained with data of a road network is able to predict traffic speed of different road networks, with the fixed number of parameters to train.},

  abstract = {The relationship between environmental degradation and economic growth has become a prominent topic in recent decades, increasing multidisciplinary approaches across a wide range of studies. Analyzing the economy-environment nexus is significant because most countries attempt to limit environmental deterioration while pursuing economic growth. This paper studies the non-linear cross-correlations between economic growth and environmental degradation on a sample of five developed European countries - France, Germany, Spain, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The study is performed using two approaches: multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis and wavelet-based analysis. According to the empirical tests, there are non-linear cross-correlations between economic growth and environmental degradation in all five countries. For each country, multifractal metrics such as Hurst exponents, scaling exponents, and multifractal spectra are computed to show the significance of all time-series pairs. The strongest multifractal features have been observed in France, Norway, and Spain. Shuffling the series suggests that multifractality in the cross-correlations arises both from a broad probability density function and from different long-term correlations. Wavelets are applied to detrend all data sets before computing the cross-correlation. Moreover, the wavelet coherence is computed as a measure for analyzing interdependencies across time and frequencies. Except for France and Spain, Wavelet-detrended cross-correlation values are considerably lower than cross-correlation values of the raw data sets, which indicates that the interdependence between growth and environmental degradation is rather long-term. In terms of wavelet coherence, results vary among the countries, with France and Spain showing the highest and most persistent coherence values.},

After estimating the volatility process without assuming any specific form of its behavior, we find the volatility to be long-term dependent with the Hurst exponent on a verge of stationarity and non-stationarity. To overcome such complication, we utilize the detrended cross-correlation and the detrending moving-average cross-correlation coefficients and we find the standard leverage effect for both crude oils and heating oil. For natural gas, we find the inverse leverage effect. Additionally, we report that the strength of the leverage effects is scale-dependent. Finally, we also show that none of the effects between returns and volatility is detected as the long-term cross-correlated one. These findings can be further utilized to enhance forecasting models and mainly in the risk management and portfolio diversification.},

We further reinvestigate the cross-correlation structure between the searches, traded volume and volatility of the component stocks using the detrended cross-correlation and detrending moving-average cross-correlation coefficients. Contrary to the universal power-law correlations structure of the related Google searches, the results suggest that there is no universal relationship between the online search queries and the analyzed financial measures.

The selection of estimators allows to separate these into the time and frequency domain estimators. By varying the characteristic exponent of the {$\alpha$}-stable distributions which controls the tails behavior, we report several interesting findings. First, the frequency domain estimators are practically unaffected by heavy tails bias-wise. Second, the time domain estimators are upward biased for heavy tails but they have lower estimator variance than the other group for short series. Third, specific estimators are more appropriate depending on distributional properties and length of the analyzed series.

For most of the stocks, the {$\beta$} parameter of the CAPM does not vary significantly across scales. There are two groups of exceptions. One of aggressive stocks which are even more aggressive for short investment horizons. These do not provide portfolio diversification benefits but allow for high profits above the market returns and even more so for the short investment horizons. And the other group of more defensive stocks which become very defensive in the long term. These stocks do not deliver short term profits but can serve as strong risk diversifiers. Apart from these direct results, our analysis opens several interesting questions and future research directions, both technical and experimental, which we discuss in more detail.},

This allows us to estimate an unbiased multilateral relationship between oil and G10 currencies. We find that the global price of oil moves multilaterally with a group of ``oil'' currencies: the Norwegian krone, the Australian dollar, the Canadian dollar and the British pound.

  abstract = {This paper presents an optimization algorithm based on Simulated Annealing. The algorithm -- denoted as CMLPSA (Corrected Multi-Level \& Multi-Point Simulated Annealing) -- implements an advanced search mechanism where each candidate design is selected from a population of trial points randomly generated. Therefore, CMLPSA is in principle similar to meta-heuristic algorithms dealing with a pool/population of designs rather than with a single trial point such as it is usually done in classical simulated annealing. The multi-point strategy is adopted for both feasible and infeasible intermediate designs. In the former case, perturbations given to optimization variables are forced to follow the current rate of change exhibited by the cost function. In the latter case, 4th order approximate line search is performed in the neighbourhood of each feasible trial point generated in the current annealing cycle. Furthermore, CMLPSA includes a multi-level annealing strategy where trial points are generated by perturbing all design variables simultaneously (global level) or one by one (local level). Global or local search is performed basing on the current trend seen in the optimization process. CMLPSA is tested in six structural optimization problems where the objective is to minimize the weight of bar trusses -- with up to 200 elements -- subject to constraints on nodal displacements, member stresses and critical buckling loads. Test cases include both sizing and lay-out optimization variables. The computationally most expensive problem has 200 design variables and 3500 optimization constraints. CMLPSA is compared with other state-of-the-art SA algorithms and advanced global optimization methods like Heuristic Particle Swarm Optimization (HPSO) and Harmony Search (HS) recently presented in literature. Numerical results clearly demonstrate efficiency and robustness of CMLPSA. In particular, CMLPSA found better designs than the other SA-based algorithms and converged much more quickly to the optimum than HPSO and HS. Furthermore, CMLPSA is insensitive to initial design.},

  abstract = {The Brazilian construction industry is going through a transition phase from the traditional design model in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to the design mediated by Building Information Modeling (BIM). Thus, there is a natural chain of adaptation of professionals to the new work methodology and, consequently, the need to train them. Therefore, Architecture and Urbanism courses in Brazil are changing their curriculum to implement the teaching of BIM. However, it has not been discussed BIM's employment alternatives in exposing its contents to training in Construction Technology. Thus, this article aims to present possibilities of using BIM in the teaching of construction technology in undergraduate Architecture and Urbanism under a case study. This study presents partial results of a master's research and uses as methodological procedures the bibliographic research, documentary research, case study, and survey. The results showed a high potential for using BIM in the teaching of construction technology, as well as in other areas of the architecture and urbanism course without the need for curriculum alteration. Finally, this study highlights the changes that can occur in the classroom if the teacher appropriates existing digital tools and if the institution and coordination support this proposal.},

We therefore proposed an HCPS framework with three dimensions---cyber-physical scale, human needs, and human roles---to summarize current research and discover potential gaps.

To test the performance of MF-TWDPCCA, we apply it and multifractal partial cross-correlation analysis (MF-DPXA) proposed by Qian et al. (2015) on simulated series. Numerical tests on artificially simulated series demonstrate that MF-TWDPCCA can more accurately detect the intrinsic cross-correlations for two simultaneously recorded series than MF-DPXA and MF-TWXDFA. To further show the utility of MF-TWDPCCA, we apply it on time series from stock markets and find that there exists significantly multifractal power-law cross-correlation between stock returns. In addition, a new partial cross-correlation coefficient is defined to quantify the level of intrinsic cross-correlation between two time series.},

A variety of methods to predict traffic variables in the short-term can be found in the literature, ranging from time-series algorithms, machine learning tools and deep learning methods to a selective hybrid of these approaches. Despite the advances in prediction techniques, a challenging problem that affects the application of such methods in the real world is the prevalence of insufficient data across an entire network. It is rare that extensive historical training data required for model training are available for all the links in a city. In order to address this data insufficiency problem, this paper applies transfer learning techniques to machine learning methods in short-term traffic prediction. All the traffic data used in this paper were collected from Highways England road networks in the UK. The results show that through improving the transferability of machine learning-based models, the computational burden due to the model training process can be significantly reduced and the prediction accuracy under data deficient scenarios can be improved for one-step ahead prediction. However, the prediction accuracy gradually decreases in multi-step ahead prediction. It is also found that the accuracy of the proposed hybrid method is highly dependent upon consistency between datasets but less dependent on geographical attributes of links.},

We employed a newly developed method---the multiscale multivariate multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MMV-MFDFA) within the framework of the fractal market hypothesis (FMH). The research target here is to detect the fractal autocorrelation characteristics for the time series covered in this study. The empirical results demonstrate that cross-correlated behaviors have multifractal features. The cross-correlated behaviors of smaller fluctuations are persistent while large fluctuations are anti-persistent between crude oil and OVX. The cross-correlated behaviors between crude oil and implied indices of the developed and emerging markets are anti-persistent both small and large fluctuations. Crude oil price fluctuations and the implied volatility indices change in a positive direction in the short term, but in the reverse direction in the long term. In addition, the multifractal strength between crude oil and implied volatility index for crude oil market is larger than that between crude oil and emerging and developed stock markets. Political, economic, and military shocks, with relatively large influence have a major impact on the internal volatility of the system. The findings of nonlinear and multifractal correlations between crude oil and implied volatility indices suggest that, due to existing of market inefficiency and multifractality,\hspace{0pt} investors can, to some extent, predict the future trends of crude oil price movements based on changes in the volatility indices, thereby adjusting their investment strategies to avoid risks.},

  abstract = {Climate change and complex anthropogenic activities have raised significant concerns regarding Precipitation-Runoff Relationships (PRR). Traditional methods, assuming stationary and linear conditions, often fail to adequately capture these intricate links. To address the limitations, we proposed an integrated framework, employing the Driving indices for Precipitation-Runoff relationships within the nonStationary and nonLinear theory approaches (DPRS and DPRL) to identify the possible driving mechanisms in PRR. The framework is validated across five sub-basins (WRB1-WRB5) within the Wei River Basin, known for its high spatiotemporal variability and intense anthropogenic activities. Spatiotemporal dynamics, nonstationary processes, and nonlinear interactions among various factors are assessed, including climate forcing, groundwater, vegetation dynamics, and anthropogenic influences. DPRS and DPRL assessments revealed that baseflow significantly influences PRR but with high uncertainty. Potential evapotranspiration plays a dominant role in driving negative PRR changes in WRB5 (weakening the correlation between precipitation and runoff), while vegetation dynamics negatively affect PRR with lower uncertainty. Anthropogenic influences represented by Impervious Surface Ratio (ISR), Night-Time Light (NTL), and population density (POP) exhibit varying driving levels, with ISR having the strongest and direct impact, closely linked to urbanization processes and scale within the study cases. The mutual validation of DPRS and DPRL confirms the dominance of baseflow in the Wei River Basin, with urbanization contributing to high ISR, NTL, and POP driving levels in WRB2 and WRB3. Afforestation policies intensify vegetation dynamics' impact in WRB4 and WRB5. This framework extends its utility to analyze various land evapotranspiration and soil moisture content at different depths in the PRR, supported by a physically-based hydrological model. Basin complexity is further employed to validate the reliability of the assessment outcomes. These insights contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of hydrological processes and facilitate informed decisions for sustainable water resource management within the basin.},

To date, however, no systematic studies have investigated the behavior of the estimator with respect to short time series. This paper fills that gap by assessing the performance of the MRA estimator using time series with varying length, distribution, and structure (e.g., autocorrelation, stationarity). Simulations show that MRA performs well under many circumstances with as few as 512 observations. Linear and quadratic time trends contribute considerable systematic bias; however, using a detrending polynomial of order {$\geq$} 2 effectively attenuates time trend associated deviations from expected values. We apply MRA to a previously published dataset in order to explore the relationship that emerges between body segments during an act of quiet standing. Results suggest that the velocity of the hip asymptotically depends on velocity of the ankle. In contrast, ankle velocity was a much weaker predictor of shoulder velocity. We conclude by providing suggestions for best practice and future model development.},

Recent cases and studies show that a key factor in this transformation is the use of urban big data from stakeholders and physical objects in cities. However, the knowledge and framework for data use for smart cities remain relatively unknown. This paper reports findings from an analysis of various use cases of big data in cities worldwide and the authors' four projects with government organizations toward developing smart cities. Specifically, this paper classifies the urban data use cases into four reference models and identifies six challenges in transforming data into information for smart cities. Furthermore, building upon the relevant literature, this paper proposes five considerations for addressing the challenges in implementing the reference models in real-world applications. The reference models, challenges, and considerations collectively form a framework for data use for smart cities. This paper will contribute to urban planning and policy development in the modern data-rich economy.},

Thus, this article formulates hypotheses for the implementation of BIM teaching in the Civil Engineering undergraduate program of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte. From exploratory field research, we propose two categories of hypotheses for BIM implementation. The first category focuses on the insertion of BIM in at least one course each semester with a robust interface with the paradigm based on the development of individual BIM competencies. The second category focuses on the coordination and teachers of an undergraduate program, focusing on teacher training and laboratory infrastructure.},

In order to identify and compare the interactions and structures of stock markets during financial crisis, as well as in normal periods, all the samples are divided into four sub-periods. The results imply that the cross-correlations between Chinese group are stronger than the US group in the most sub-periods. In particular, it is likely that the US stock markets are more integrated with each other during global financial crisis than during Asian financial crisis.

Using a detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA), we find that the return cross-correlations are persistent for corn and soybean and anti-persistent for oat and soybean. The volatility cross-correlations are strongly persistent. Using a nonlinear cross-correlation measure, our results show that cross-correlations are relatively weak but they are significant for smaller time scales. For larger time scales, the cross-correlations are not significant. The reason may be that information transmission from crude oil market to agriculture markets can complete within a certain period of time. Finally, based on multifractal extension of DCCA, we find that the cross-correlations are multifractal and high oil prices partly contribute to food crisis during the period of 2006--mid-2008.},

Based on multiple heterogeneous data sources, which include aggregated mobility change reports and household survey data, this paper proposes a machine learning approach for dynamic activity chain pattern estimation with improved interpretability for examining behavioral pattern adjustments. Based on historical household survey samples, we first establish a computational graph-based discrete choice model to estimate the baseline travel tour parameters before the pandemic. To further capture structural deviations of activity chain patterns from day-by-day time series, we define the activity-oriented deviation parameters within an interpretable utility-based nested logit model framework, which are further estimated through a constrained optimization problem. By incorporating the long short-term memory method as the explainable module to capture the complex periodic and trend information before and after interventions, we predict day-to-day activity chain patterns with more accuracy. The performance of our model is examined based on publicly available datasets such as the 2017 National Household Travel Survey in the United States and the Google Global Mobility Dataset throughout the epidemic period. Our model could shed more light on transportation planning, policy adaptation and management decisions during the pandemic and post-pandemic phases.},

We compared the classified results with classical MDS which use the Euclidean distance as a measure of similarity and {$\sigma$}DCCA-based MDS. The results show that using Hurst-surface distance as a reflection of similarity can not only provide more information about correlation but also distinguish the differences of economic volatility in different regions. While {$\sigma$}DCCA puts more emphasis on the similarities and dissimilarities within the same region. Those two modified MDS technology above are better than the classical method based on Euclidean, they can reflect more detailed and clearer information.},

Available examples are mostly experimental, limited in scope, and without an obvious transfer to practice. Yet, a substantial number of academics and practitioners envision that the use of big data will have a significant impact on how decisions are made in the building design process, providing designers with an unprecedented amount of exceptionally detailed data on buildings and their occupants that is redefining what can be observed, modeled, simulated, predicted and measured in the industry. We first review the main concepts and technologies that shape this technological phenomenon, and then, based on the survey of around 100 cases of applications of big data and machine learning throughout all phases of building design we identify 12 clusters of applications where the technology seems to be more disruptive. The discussion then focuses on the transformative impacts of the technology on three niches where further research is more urgently needed: 1) understanding the design problem; 2) simulating and predicting the holistic performance of the design solution; 3) evaluating integrally and continuously the design product during its complete lifecycle.}

A quantitative technique of multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) is used to explore the multifractal features of the cross-correlations between USD/JPY, AUD/JPY exchange rates and the market anxiety gauge VIX. The investigation shows that the causal relationship between Japanese Yen exchange rates and VIX are bidirectional in general, and the cross-correlations between the two sets of time series are multifractal. Strong evidence suggests that the cross-correlation exponents tend to exhibit different volatility patterns in response to diverse external shocks such as financial distress and widening in interest rate spread, suggesting that the cross-correlated behavior between Japanese Yen exchange rates and VIX are susceptible to economic uncertainties and risks. In addition, the performances of two market anxiety gauges, the VIX and the TED spread, are compared and the sources of multifractality are also traced. Thus, this paper contributes to the literature by shedding light on the unique driving forces of the Yen exchange rate fluctuations in the international foreign exchange market.},

  abstract = {High-rise buildings of complex shapes are becoming more common in the last few decades. When designing the structures for these buildings, the wind pressure distribution and its history must be considered. The vortex shedding makes the attainment of comfort criteria particularly challenging. Through high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES), it is possible to obtain satisfactory predictions of wind pressure statistics. However, the computational demands of LES are overwhelming, and its use has been impracticable for most wind engineering applications. This scenario might change with the decline in hardware costs (relative to processing capacity) and alternative computational fluid dynamics paradigms. In this paper, we present a CFD-LES simulations of complex shaped high-rise buildings using a lattice-Boltzmann solver with high performance GPU computing. Results are presented in terms of statistical properties and power spectral density of pressure coefficients.

  abstract = {In this paper Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and finite element analysis are employed in topology optimization of 2D and 3D structural models. The aim is to find the stiffest structure with a certain amount of material, based on the element's contribution to the strain energy. The ACO algorithm provides a suitable tool to handle the problem as an on-off discrete optimization. In this method, the analogy with ants determining the shortest path to food is the decision for an element to be eliminated or to remain. The main effect of using this approach lies in the fact that the problems of topology optimization can be reformulated as discrete problems with no limitation. Examples of 2D and 3D models are provided to show the applicability of the present method. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paradigm shift has also set up new expectations on college students for their competencies in sustainability and BIM. While most higher education institutions have already incorporated such topics in their curricula, green building and BIM are typically taught separately. In this study, instructors from two classes adopted an integrated approach and designed a joint course project focusing on both sustainable design and BIM implementation. With BIM facilitation, students collaborated in teams working on artefacts and other tasks to accomplish predefined sustainable goals for a real building project. The project based learning provides an ideal framework to evaluate critical factors that influence the execution of BIM in green building project delivery. Formative and summative assessments of student learning outcomes in model communication, teamwork, critical thinking, problem-solving, and sustainability were conducted. The results of this study provide insight into innovative pedagogic design for sustainability and BIM education in the AEC curricula. The study also confirmed the effectiveness of project based learning in cultivating student competencies in critical thinking and problem-solving within a multidisciplinary project environment.},

Moreover, using the multifractal spectrum, we can also verify the multifractal characteristics between the crude oil market and the six GCC stock markets. Furthermore, we use the penalized contrast function to detect the structural break points of the WTI-Oil return series and its conditional volatility, and then discuss the cross-correlations between the crude oil and the six GCC stock markets in the different phases according to these break points. At last, we employ the technique of the rolling window to investigate the dynamic of the scaling exponent Hxy(q).

Considering the fat-tail distribution of return time series, statistical test based on shuffling method is conducted to verify the null hypothesis of no long-term dependence. Our empirical research displays three main findings. First Shanghai equity market efficiency deteriorated while Shenzhen equity market efficiency improved with the advent of financial crisis. Second the highly positive dependence between SHCI and SZCI varies with time scale. Third financial crisis saw a significant increase of dependence between SHCI and SZCI at shorter time scales but a lack of significant change at longer time scales, providing evidence of contagion and absence of interdependence during crisis.},

At the same time, looked at from the point of view of autocorrelation (DFA), this analysis can be more informative depending on time scale. For short scale (days), we cannot identify auto-correlations, on the scale of weeks DFA presents anti-persistent behavior, and for long time scales (n{\textquestiondown}90 days) DFA presents a persistent behavior. Finally, the application of this new type of statistical analysis proved to be efficient and, in this sense, this paper can contribute to a more accurate descriptive statistics of crime.},

The first analysis of their individual experiences, through semi-structured interviews, indicates that the integration of bioclimatic concepts into design is beyond the development or improvement of tools. First of all, it is fundamental that these concepts are part of the design philosophy of the professional, which is determinant on the application of research and innovation in architectural practice. Therefore, before the tools, the formal education can be a tool to promote the inclusion of these principles as part of their design philosophy, influencing the approach to design. It happened in the cases in which there was a commitment of the school to develop a technical knowledge basis in building physics into studio activities, highlighting the aesthetic character of environmental integration. This basis was consolidated in the contact with the building site construction, which also strengthened their ethical commitment regarding the quality of the built object. It has the potential to generate confidence in the consideration of these issues, also making it easier to get the right information from available resources and tools, via a critical understanding of the different issues.},

  abstract = {Smart cities are nowadays equipped with pervasive networks of sensors that monitor traffic in real-time and record huge volumes of traffic data. These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from {$\sim$}1.3 billion records collected by up to 272 sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built according to the three aforementioned approaches. The results show that the global and cluster-based approaches provide very accurate prediction models that prove to be robust to changes in traffic behavior and in the structure of sensor networks.},

Contractors and contracted parties report a lack of a document that for all stages of BIM project development defines their scope and responsibilities. In this regard, this article proposes guidelines for a BIM Execution Plan (PEB) development for construction projects contracts aiming to guide relationship between process stakeholders - especially those from Santa Catarina (state in the southern region of Brazil) - within BIM model production process that meet the needs of designers and contractors. From a systematic review of literature and BIM adoption analysis in the companies studied - through questionnaires, interviews and process flow mapping - it was developed the PEB content guidelines and suggested a flow to implement the proposed PEB for a project. Validation was done through interviews with industry experts.},

In this paper, we propose the method of transfer entropy based on the theory of time-delay reconstruction of a phase space, which is a model-free approach to detect causalities in multivariate time series. This method overcomes the limitation that original transfer entropy only can capture which system drives the transition probabilities of another in scalar time series. Using artificial time series, we show that the driving character is obviously reflected with the increase of the coupling strength between two signals and confirm the effectiveness of the method with noise added. Furthermore, we utilize it to real-world data, namely financial time series, in order to characterize the information flow among different stocks.},

Lack of such a comprehensive decision-making framework which utilizes BIM, Management Information Systems (MIS), simulation, and automation tools to choose between different construction alternatives have been addressed in the research background. As an example of decision-making objective, optimized smart building's equipment combination for a certain project should be selected in the feasibility study phase. In this research, a comprehensive decision-making framework was developed to choose smart building's equipment based on energy consumption and cost trade-off. Subsequently, smart building alternatives were considered as a decision-making example to choose the best alternative using BIM, MIS and simulation tools. The research contributes to the automating of some parts of the decision-making framework by developing an Application Programming Interface (API). This API helps with making the appropriate automating permutation out of possible options, totalizing the cost of each combination and sorting data in the research database developed for the recommended framework. This framework, database and API can be used similarly for any other decision making objective. Finally, a model representing the average conditions of residential buildings in Tehran was developed to choose the optimized smart building's equipment combination of 31 considered options. This optimized combination which included all possible smart building options except for smart lighting has an investment return of about 7.5 years which is more than that of similar projects in other countries due to Iran's low energy carrier tariff.},

We construct the minimum spanning tree using the cross-correlation of the returns computed from the closing price data. The research findings show that the South African stock market network forms clusters and is homogeneous, and the finance industry plays a central role. Specifically, the results show an expansion of MST during the level 5 lockdown and shrinkage of the MST post level 5 lockdown. The average correlation coefficient decreases through all sub-periods; conversely, the average distance increases in all sub-periods. Post-level 5 lockdown period, stocks in the Health Care Equipment \& Services sector form a small cluster that did not exist before the lockdown period.

What makes this frustrating is that private companies hold potentially useful data, but it is not accessible by the people who can use it to track poverty, reduce disease, or build urban infrastructure. This project set out to test whether we can transform an openly available dataset (Twitter) into a resource for urban planning and development. We test our hypothesis by creating road traffic crash location data, which is scarce in most resource-poor environments but essential for addressing the number one cause of mortality for children over five and young adults. The research project scraped 874,588 traffic related tweets in Nairobi, Kenya, applied a machine learning model to capture the occurrence of a crash, and developed an improved geoparsing algorithm to identify its location. We geolocate 32,991 crash reports in Twitter for 2012-2020 and cluster them into 22,872 unique crashes during this period. For a subset of crashes reported on Twitter, a motorcycle delivery service was dispatched in real-time to verify the crash and its location; the results show 92\% accuracy. To our knowledge this is the first geolocated dataset of crashes for the city and allowed us to produce the first crash map for Nairobi. Using a spatial clustering algorithm, we are able to locate portions of the road network ({$<$}1\%) where 50\% of the crashes identified occurred. Even with limitations in the representativeness of the data, the results can provide urban planners with useful information that can be used to target road safety improvements where resources are limited. The work shows how twitter data might be used to create other types of essential data for urban planning in resource poor environments.},

  abstract = {The development of smart cities and their fast-paced deployment is resulting in the generation of large quantities of data at unprecedented rates. Unfortunately, most of the generated data is wasted without extracting potentially useful information and knowledge because of the lack of established mechanisms and standards that benefit from the availability of such data. Moreover, the high dynamical nature of smart cities calls for new generation of machine learning approaches that are flexible and adaptable to cope with the dynamicity of data to perform analytics and learn from real-time data. In this article, we shed the light on the challenge of under utilizing the big data generated by smart cities from a machine learning perspective. Especially, we present the phenomenon of wasting unlabeled data. We argue that semi-supervision is a must for smart city to address this challenge. We also propose a three-level learning framework for smart cities that matches the hierarchical nature of big data generated by smart cities with a goal of providing different levels of knowledge abstractions. The proposed framework is scalable to meet the needs of smart city services. Fundamentally, the framework benefits from semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning where a small amount of data that has users' feedback serves as labeled data while a larger amount is without such users' feedback serves as unlabeled data. This paper also explores how deep reinforcement learning and its shift toward semi-supervision can handle the cognitive side of smart city services and improve their performance by providing several use cases spanning the different domains of smart cities. We also highlight several challenges as well as promising future research directions for incorporating machine learning and high-level intelligence into smart city services.},

The transport literature is also sparse when it comes to city-scale traffic predictions, mainly because of low data availability. In this work, we report an effort to investigate whether deep learning models can be useful for the long-term large-scale traffic prediction task, while focusing on the scalability of the models. We investigate a city-scale traffic dataset with 14 weeks of speed observations collected every 15 minutes over 1098 segments in the hypercenter of Los Angeles, California. We look at a variety of state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning predictors for link-based predictions, and investigate how such predictors can scale up to larger areas with clustering, and graph convolutional approaches. We discuss that modelling temporal and spatial features into deep learning predictors can be helpful for long-term predictions, while simpler, not deep learning-based predictors, achieve very satisfactory performance for link-based and short-term forecasting. The trade-off is discussed not only in terms of prediction accuracy vs prediction horizon but also in terms of training time and model sizing.},

  abstract = {Urban energy modelling requires a large amount of detailed data to perform systematic dynamic simulations of a large number of buildings, where the adoption of energy efficiency strategies is an important concern for sustainable urban planning. National statistical datasets collect important aggregated data regarding building construction, energy consumption and occupants, and cities are making a significant effort to update spatial referenced data of their territory. However, these data is generally not detailed enough, being available at different scales and in different formats. The integrated use of these data is critical to validate different methods to predict and model energy consumption in cities, as well in addressing its energy saving potential. Furthermore, scenario analysis for retrofit or new design is only possible at building scale, highlighting the potential of a bottom-up database. This paper presents the process of collecting, mapping, cleansing and integrating urban data resulting in an UBD to support an information system for Smart Cities. The goal is to reduce the gap between the available urban data and the specific data required to run a complete urban building energy simulation. Key characteristics of an UBD are explored and applied to a case study in Lisbon, Portugal. As a result, a Buildings Dashboard is developed, materializing the UBD user interface. This dashboard allows the interactive visualization and data exploration of the building stock at multiple scales. Future work includes the development of an Urban Scenario category, bringing new insights on urban energy simulation and scenario evaluation to this platform.},

While the method is well-established and well-understood for single time series data, its extensions for multivariate data (comprising multiple channels) are still emerging. A major challenge in that regard is to incorporate inherent inter-channel dependencies within the DFA analysis. We propose a novel method to address that challenge through Mahalanobis distance (MD) norm that provides an analytical way to incorporate covariance matrix within the computation of the proposed multichannel fluctuation function. Through analytical analysis and experimental results, we show that incorporation of cross-channel correlations within the fluctuation function makes the rendered long-range correlation analysis more accurate for the multivariate correlated data. Next, we next demonstrate the utility of the proposed generic multichannel DFA (GMDFA) within the multivariate signal denoising problem(s). To this end, our denoising approach first obtains data driven multiscale signal representation by multi-stage use of multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) method. Then, proposed GMDFA is used to reject the predominantly noisy modes based on their randomness scores.},

  abstract = {The trading volume in stock markets is known as an important variable which reflects the liquidity of the financial markets and therefore is regarded to be greatly important for the measurement of market liquidity risk. In this work, a new concept called recurrence duration is introduced for study of daily trading volumes, which is inspired by idea of the volatility duration that was proposed and studied in our previous work. The recurrence duration is thought as the shortest passing time that the following days' trading volume takes to exceed or go below the current trading volume which is time-varying. Similar to the volatility duration distribution of the price returns, the power-law function could describe the empirical probability distribution of recurrence durations of trading volumes, and their tail distributions can be fitted by two stretched exponential functions. Further, the correlation relationships of trading volumes between Chinese stock indices as well as the correlations of recurrence durations are investigated. One approach employed is a recently proposed method, time-dependent intrinsic correlation (TDIC), which is based on the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) to decompose nonlinear and nonstationary signals into the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), the instantaneous periods of which are used then in determination of the sizes of sliding windows to compute the running correlation coefficients for the multiscale signals. The empirical results reveal rich patterns of correlations for both trading volumes and recurrence durations at different scales for different modes. Another approach is the widely-used DCCA cross-correlation coefficient, by which the level of cross-correlation is measured for both original series and IMF modes of the stock indices.},

Recent advancements in behavioral time series analyses have produced increasing evidence of global coordination, matching in statistical structures of fluctuation in long timescales, separate from synchronization as local coordination. Previous studies have demonstrated that strong interactions in local timescales and interactions in multiple scales with weak local interactions can be sources of global coordination. However, knowledge of global coordination in human rhythmic movement is still limited. The present study investigated fluctuation and coordination dynamics for inter-tap intervals (ITI) in a paired rhythmic tapping task, imitating duo performances, from local to global timescales. In addition, we examined parameter dynamics for a coupled oscillator model to test whether the model could replicate the task dynamics and integrate sources of global coordination. Measured ITI series demonstrated globally coordinated hybrid dynamics: persistent fluctuation and positively correlated coordination in global scales and anti-persistent fluctuation and negatively correlated coordination in local scales. Positive lag {\textpm}1 and negative lag 0 local cross-correlation suggested that the global coordination was emerged from local mutual timing adjustment processes. The coupled oscillator model for the task replicated these dynamics. Moreover, the model could generate both types of global coordination, which emerged from strong and weak local interactions. These findings can help to improve knowledge of interpersonal coordination in musical ensembles, allowing a better understanding, for example, of the basis of temporal harmony and individual differences in the coordination of each pair and their source.},

  abstract = {The need to design and construct structural systems with adequate levels of reliability and redundancy is widely acknowledged. It is as crucial that these desired levels are maintained above target levels throughout the life of the structure. Optimization has served well in providing safer and more economical maintenance strategies. Lifetime maintenance optimization based on system reliability has already been proposed. It is still needed, however, to incorporate redundancy in the lifetime maintenance optimization process. Treating both system reliability and redundancy as criteria in the lifetime optimization process can be highly rewarding. The complexity of the process, however, requires the automation of solving the optimization problem. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are used in this study to obtain solutions to the multi-objective optimization problems considering system reliability, redundancy and life-cycle cost (LCC). An approach to provide the optimization program the ability to optimally select what maintenance actions are applied, when they are applied, and to which structural components they are applied is presented. Two different strategies are proposed. The first strategy has the ability to optimally select mixed maintenance types to apply to different parts of the structure at the same time. This strategy can be used in cases where any combination of different maintenance options can be practically applied to any part of the structure. The application of this strategy on truss structures is shown in a numerical example. The second strategy can be used when a limited number of possibilities of practical maintenance options are available. The application of this strategy to bridge structures is shown in a numerical example. The greatest advantage of the proposed approach (both strategies) is its ability to avoid the application of maintenance interventions to structural components that are not critical. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {EEG is one of the techniques more used to assess the extent of damage from these deficiencies and even to find solutions such as rehabilitation or limb replacement using a bionic prosthesis, through brain-computer interface. That is why it is of vital importance that we understand the functioning of the primary motor cortex of the brain in the control of real/imaginary tasks. From Physionet database, with two-minute EEG recordings in three different experiments (real/imaginary), we applied DFA and DCCA methods to find auto-correlations and cross-correlations. DFA method was capable of quantitatively describing similarities when the brain performs the same motor task, and show there are three time-scales. After, in order to compare the fluctuation amplitude of an EEG signal in relation to the other channels and measure these cross-correlations, we applied ∆ log FDFA function and {$\rho$}DCCA coefficient. Thus, choosing the F3 channel (front) as the reference, we identified generally that: ∆ log FDFA[F3 : xx] {$\geq$} 0 and {$\rho$}DCCA {$>$} 0. The channels: Cz , F6, T9, and T10, are those that have a higher level of DCCA cross-correlation, if compared to the channel F3. The time scale II, with 16 {$<$} n {$\leq$} 723, is the one with {$\rho$}DCCA maximum. Finally, the statistic applied in this paper, based on the DFA-method, proved to be an excellent candidate for studies of motor functions in the brain computer interface area.},

Climate change is identified by WHO and other international health authorities as one of the primary factors that contribute to the rapid spread of dengue fever. Methods We evaluated the effect of sanitation on the cross-correlation between rainfall and the first symptoms of dengue in the city of Mato Grosso do Sul, which is in a state in the Midwest region of Brazil, and employed the time-lagged detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCAC) method. Results Co--movements were obtained through the time-phased DCCAC to analyze the effects of climatic variables on arboviruses. The use of a time-lag analysis was more robust than DCCAC without lag to present the behavior of dengue cases in relation to accumulated precipitation. Our results show that the cross-correlation between rain and dengue increased as the city implemented actions to improve basic sanitation in the city. Conclusion With climate change and the increase in the global average temperature, mosquitoes are advancing beyond the tropics, and our results show that cities with improved sanitation have a high correlation between dengue and annual precipitation. Public prevention and control policies can be targeted according to the period of time and the degree of correlation calculated to structure vector control and prevention work in places where sanitation conditions are adequate.},

  abstract = {The process of reading a specific text is considered complex and little known in neuroscience, since it involves the vision, memory, motor control, learning, among others. In this sense, an excellent possibility to study the brain activity in the reading task can be achieved by the analysis of the multi-channel Electroencephalogram (EEG) and also with new statistical methods, like the detrended fluctuation analysis method (DFA). In this paper it will be proposed a model to analyze the brain activity in the reading task, performed by two subjects using a 22-channels EEG (NEUROMAP{\textregistered} model EQSA260). In order to test our model, two adults subjects (graduates) were tested here. These subjects were arranged in a chair facing a panel with the specific text, excluding involuntary movements that activated regions of the brain that were not being stimulated by reading. For the first subject, chosen at random, the text was presented before the task for understanding and some memorization. For the other subject the text was presented at the time of task. For the signal processing we chose 11 bio-electrodes located at the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital regions of the brain. Therefore, to treat these non-stationary bio-signals we must apply robust and modern statistical techniques. With this objective, DFA method was applied in order to analyze the FDFA(n) fluctuation function in multi-channel EEG bio-sensors, more specifically the difference of its logarithm, i.e., ∆logFDFA. The results show that the use of this new function can be useful for brain activities. This paper, as we shall see here, is an initial contribution for EEG data analyze, that would be of medical interest, mainly in neuroscience area.},

To do this, we study 5 of active EGG channels during arithmetic tests. For the series generated by the test, we applied the DFA method to assess the autocorrelation of the series, here representing the areas: frontal, central and parietal in two mo- ments of the scales, n {$\leq$} 60 and n {$>$} 60 (30 seconds). We also investigate the rms root mean square function at three moments of the scale, n {$<$} 10 (5 seconds), 10 {$<$} n {$<$} 100 and n {$>$} 100 (50 seconds). The results found revealed non-stationary behavior with Brownian noise transition for n 60 {$\geq$} and persistence for n {$>$} 60. With the rms root mean square function, on average, we verified that the central region, when compared to the other re- gions, the results revealed a positive difference for the fluctuation amplitude, with the exception of Cz(2) - Af4(9) em n {$>$} 100. Our findings pointed out that modeling DFA and rms function was useful for investigating responses to brain stimuli. Our research is a contribution to EEG analysis and to the areas of biophysics, systems analysis and digital signal processing.},

  abstract = {The degree of energy efficiency of buildings depends on decisions taken in the early stages of architectural design. However, energy performance assessment programs require information that is usually defined in the final stages of the project. If the performance is unsatisfactory, a whole rework needs to be undertaken. The objective of this work is to develop a tool to support the designer informing the energy efficiency level of single-family homes in the initial phases of design considering the Technical Quality Regulation for the Energy Efficiency Level of Residential Buildings (RTQ-R), reference Brazilian standard. Consequently, the IDEEA tool was developed using the Design Science methodology, based on the Autodesk Revit BIM modeling tool, with the programming languages Dynamo and Python. Integrating the information stored in the parametric model with the calculation processes. Scripts for model performance calculations collect information, process data, execute equations, and present the results of the energy efficiency of the environments, the envelope and the housing unit (ventilating, heating, and cooling), and the total score. These performances are presented in tables and graphic elements, in a friendly way for reading, analyzing and defining the project's direction. The evaluation of the tool was carried out in the form of a project to verify the accuracy of the results and academic workshop to verify usability. It was observed that the friendly interface enabled assimilation by the volunteers participating in the workshop, suggesting ease of incorporation into the creative process of each designer. Thus, enabling the optimized obtaining of the National Energy Conservation Label, granted under the Brazilian Labeling Program of INMETRO.},

  abstract = {The emergence of smart cities aims at mitigating the challenges raised due to the continuous urbanization development and increasing population density in cities. To face these challenges, governments and decision makers undertake smart city projects targeting sustainable economic growth and better quality of life for both inhabitants and visitors. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a key enabling technology for city smartening. However, ICT artifacts and applications yield massive volumes of data known as big data. Extracting insights and hidden correlations from big data is a growing trend in information systems to provide better services to citizens and support the decision making processes. However, to extract valuable insights for developing city level smart information services, the generated datasets from various city domains need to be integrated and analyzed. This process usually referred to as big data analytics or big data value chain. Surveying the literature reveals an increasing interest in harnessing big data analytics applications in general and in the area of smart cities in particular. Yet, comprehensive discussions on the essential characteristics of big data analytics frameworks fitting smart cities requirements are still needed. This paper presents a novel big data analytics framework for smart cities called ``Smart City Data Analytics Panel --- SCDAP''. The design of SCDAP is based on answering the following research questions: what are the characteristics of big data analytics frameworks applied in smart cities in literature and what are the essential design principles that should guide the design of big data analytics frameworks have to serve smart cities purposes? In answering these questions, we adopted a systematic literature review on big data analytics frameworks in smart cities. The proposed framework introduces new functionalities to big data analytics frameworks represented in data model management and aggregation. The value of the proposed framework is discussed in comparison to traditional knowledge discovery approaches.},

The non-stationary time series are scrutinized within the Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis (DCCA) framework, where the resulting DCCA coefficient provides a useful and reliable index to the evaluate the cross correlation between events at the same time instant as well as at a suitably chosen time lags. The analysis is based on the quotient of two successive daily closing oil prices and composite indices of renewable energy sources in USA and Europe in the period 2006--2015, which was subject to several social and economic driving forces, as the increase of social pressure in favor of the use of non-fossil energy sources and the worldwide economic crisis that started in 2008. The DCCA coefficient is evaluated for different window sizes, extracting information for short and long term correlation between the indices. Particularly, strong correlation between the behavior of the two distinct economic sectors are observed for large time intervals during the worst period of the economic crisis (2008--2012), hinting at a very cautious behavior of the economic agents. Before and after this period, the behavior of two economic sectors are overwhelmingly uncorrelated or very weakly correlated. The results reported here may be useful to select proper strategies in future similar scenarios.},

Unlike the previous studies that exogenously imposed break dates for dividing the time series into sub-samples, we tested whether the mean of the crude oil price changed over time to find evidence for structural changes in the crude oil price series and endogenously determine three break dates with minimum Bayesian information criterion scores. Accordingly, we divided the entire study period in four sample periods ---  January 1990 to October 1999, November 1999 to February 2005, March 2005 to September 2010, and October 2010 to July 2016, where the third sample period coincided with the period of food crisis and enabled us to compare the fuel--food interdependence across pre-crisis, during the crisis, and post-crisis periods. The results of the detrended cross correlation analysis extended corroborative evidence for increasing positive interdependence between the crude oil price and world food price index along with its sub-categories, namely dairy, cereals, vegetable oil, and sugar. The article ends with the implications of these results in the domain of food policy and the financial sector.},

However, it is difficult to adopt these developed SSM to reflect real-world traffic conditions when the developed network in the simulation is not calibrated and validated accordingly. This paper proposed a method to develop the pattern-based surrogate safety measure (PSSM) using individual vehicle trajectory data. The PSSM can be estimated based on the pattern of hazardous driving behaviour (HDB). Using digital tacho graph data collected from the commercial vehicles, HDB patterns were obtained. Various PSSMs were developed and validated with the observed crash data using Random Forest. Then, the surrogate safety performance function was estimated based on the frequency of HDB. To enhance model performance, machine learning and data mining techniques were applied. The results show that sudden deceleration, sudden lane change, sudden overtaking and sudden U-turn are related to traffic crashes during HDB. The results also show that high potential for safety improvement was identified in the road section linking the urban and suburban areas. The findings from this study can provide new approach to adopt real-time individual vehicle trajectory data to evaluate safety performance of network levels.},

In this paper, we identify links between methodologies in two fields: video prediction and spatiotemporal traffic forecasting. The similarities of the video stream and citywide traffic data structures are discovered and analogues between historical development and modern states of the methodologies are presented and discussed. The idea of transferring video prediction models to the urban traffic forecasting domain is validated using a large real-world traffic data set. The list of transferred techniques includes spatial filtering by predefined kernels in combination with time series models and spectral graph convolutional artificial neural networks. The obtained models' forecasting performance is compared to the baseline traffic forecasting models: non-spatial time series models and spatially regularized vector autoregression models. We conclude that the application of video prediction models and algorithms for urban traffic forecasting is effective both in terms of observed forecasting accuracy and development, and training efforts. Finally, we discuss problems and obstacles of transferring methodologies and present potential directions for further research.},

The review shows that the mapping methodologies vary in space and time, going from a global scale to a microscale. Studies use observed data, such as land-based monitoring stations, upper-air stations, wind towers, and satellite data. Additionally, they use meteorological modeling, such as analysis and reanalysis from global models, and mesoscale and microscale models. The complementarity analysis uses mainly correlation techniques such as Pearson's, Spearman, or Kendall's correlation. However, some studies pointed out that these techniques are unsuitable for analyzing wind and solar time series. This brings additional research and methods to assess and evaluate the complementarity between energy sources, reinforcing that there is no standard or common methodology to perform complementarity analyses. The patent survey has shown that most patents are regarding power plant components, configuration, energy storage in hybrid systems, computational fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence techniques for improving power plant operation. A case study was established to illustrate the methodology of mapping the solar and wind potential and their complementarity.}

  abstract = {Accurate and real-time traffic passenger flows forecasting at transportation hubs, such as subway/bus stations, is a practical application and of great significance for urban traffic planning, control, guidance, etc. Recently deep learning based methods are promised to learn the spatial-temporal features from high non-linearity and complexity of traffic flows. However, it is still very challenging to handle so much complex factors including the urban transportation network topological structures and the laws of traffic flows with spatial and temporal dependencies. Considering both the static hybrid urban transportation network structures and dynamic spatial-temporal relationships among stations from historical traffic passenger flows, a more effective and fine-grained spatial-temporal features learning framework is necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal incidence dynamic graph neural networks framework for urban traffic passenger flows prediction. We first model dynamic traffic station relationships over time as spatial-temporal incidence dynamic graph structures based on historically traffic passenger flows. Then we design a novel dynamic graph recurrent convolutional neural network, namely Dynamic-GRCNN, to learn the spatial-temporal features representation for urban transportation network topological structures and transportation hubs. To fully utilize the historical passenger flows, we sample the short-term, medium-term and long-term historical traffic data in training, which can capture the periodicity and trend of the traffic passenger flows at different stations. We conduct extensive experiments on different types of traffic passenger flows datasets including subway, taxi and bus flows in Beijing. The results show that the proposed Dynamic-GRCNN effectively captures comprehensive spatial-temporal correlations significantly and outperforms both traditional and deep learning based urban traffic passenger flows prediction methods.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to analyze the stock exchanges for a large set of countries (20 in total) before and after the subprime crisis, identifying which markets are the most central and if the linkage pattern changed after the crisis. We started by calculating the correlations between stock markets' returns, using the {$\rho$}DCCA, in order to identify if there is some variation in the scale between the links in the different stock markets of the network, in both periods. Additionally, a cross-correlation filtering process will be performed with the intention of identifying which countries have stronger relationships according to the used time scales. The results show the central role of European markets among the world's main financial markets, mainly France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Moreover, after the subprime crisis we find the formation of two large communities, one of European and American countries and the other formed by Asian countries plus Australia, while in the pre-crisis period three communities could be identified. It is possible to conclude that after the 2008 crisis the connectivity and integration of the network for the whole set of analyzed timescales increased.},

  abstract = {In this paper, an information-based measure of association between time series, called information-based correlation coefficient (ICC), is introduced to potentially overcome some of the problems related to Pearson's correlation coefficient and other commonly used coefficients. The ICC, besides its simple definition, seems to have other interesting advantages over traditional correlation coefficients, such as a more natural interpretation in terms of the reciprocal informativeness between two series, higher reliability for independent white noise, Student's t, and AR(1) processes, higher reliability in the presence of spurious correlation and outliers, and a well-developed mathematical theory based on entropy. The ICC can also detect a number of nonlinear relationships, although it may not be equitable and general. Moreover, the ICC can be computed also for ordinal data, and it offers higher reliability for independent ordinal-valued time series. Monte Carlo simulations, applications to real data, properties of the estimator and asymptotics under independence are also discussed in this paper. In particular, the paper includes applications to signal processing, chaotic time series, macroeconomic and weather data.},

  abstract = {Computers have now become a crucial component in the process of digital media contents creation. Computer programs have been written to generate artistic artifacts, for examples, poetry, painting and music. These artifacts could be classified along the spectrum of algorithmic complexity of the programs, where order is at one end and disorder is at the other end. The artifacts classified toward the order end of the spectrum possess a clear structure (e.g., symmetry and tiling) while the artifacts classified toward the disorder end do not have any structure at both local and global levels (e.g., randomisation). Highly ordered or disordered generative art artifacts are generated from efficient algorithms that are simpler than those used to generate artifacts classified as lying between the order and disorder extremes. Control is embedded in the programs and it expresses the intention and strategy of the creative process. In this paper, we investigate the issue of control in generative art. We argue that the control expressed in the programs is a crucial component in a generative process. Hence, the ability to exert control is important in guiding the creative processes to intentionally generate complex and interesting artifacts. We describe the nature of the control observed in the generative process of computer generative art techniques. We then present examples of computer generated painting and discuss the control employed in the generative processes. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {In the era of ``big data'', recent developments in the area of information and communication technologies (ICT) are facilitating organizations to innovate and grow. These technological developments and wide adaptation of ubiquitous computing enable numerous opportunities for government and companies to reconsider healthcare prospects. Therefore, big data and smart healthcare systems are independently attracting extensive attention from both academia and industry. The combination of both big data and smart systems can expedite the prospects of the healthcare industry. However, a thorough study of big data and smart systems together in the healthcare context is still absent from the existing literature. The key contributions of this article include an organized evaluation of various big data and smart system technologies and a critical analysis of the state-of-the-art advanced healthcare systems. We describe the three-dimensional structure of a paradigm shift. We also extract three broad technical branches (3T) contributing to the promotion of healthcare systems. More specifically, we propose a big data enabled smart healthcare system framework (BSHSF) that offers theoretical representations of an intra and inter organizational business model in the healthcare context. We also mention some examples reported in the literature, and then we contribute to pinpointing the potential opportunities and challenges of applying BSHSF to healthcare business environments. We also make five recommendations for effectively applying `BSHSF to the healthcare industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in-depth study about state-of-the-art big data and smart healthcare systems in parallel. The managerial implication of this article is that organizations can use the findings of our critical analysis to reinforce their strategic arrangement of smart systems and big data in the healthcare context, and hence better leverage them for sustainable organizational invention.},

There are numerous blackouts due to interfering the trees with the power transmission lines in hilly and urban areas. Power distribution companies are facing a challenge to monitor the vegetation to avoid blackouts and flash-over threats. Recently, several methods have been developed for vegetation monitoring; however, existing methods are either not accurate or could not provide better disparity map in the textureless region. Moreover, are not able to handle depth discontinuity in stereo thus are not able to find a feasible solution in the smooth areas to compute the disparity map. This study presents a cost-effective framework based on UAV and satellite Stereo images to monitor the trees and vegetation, which provide better disparity. We present a novel approach based on the fusion of the convolutional neural network (CNN) and sparse representation that handled textureless region, depth discontinuity and smooth region to produce better disparity map that further used for threat estimation using height and distance of vegetation/trees near power lines and poles. Extensive experimental evaluation on real time powerline monitoring showed considerable imporvemnt in vegetation threat estimation with accuracy of 90.3\% in comparison to graph-cut, dynamic programming, belief propagation, and area-based methods.},

Using the multifractality analysis, we conclude that China's monetary policy can significantly reduce the multifractality of cross-correlations between the RMB exchange rate and Shibor rate markets, and that market efficiency in the third stage of policy reform is improved. Furthermore, the source of multifractality of cross-correlations is found mostly in the nonlinear correlation and fat-tailed probability distribution (PDF) components.},

The interaction between CNY and CNH market pairs was examined with attention to how the floating exchange rate regime reform of August 11, 2015 affects their interactions. The obtained results suggest that net power-law cross-correlations exist between the CNY and CNH exchange markets (with influences of autocorrelation, interest rate difference, US Dollar, and Oil signals removed) and that the August 11, 2015 (referred to as ``811'') exchange reform significantly affects the trend of multiscale cross-correlation coefficient curves. This study also verifies that the risk of offshore RMB markets in Europe and the UK is larger than in Hong Kong and the US when facing a large shock. The nonlinear causal effect analysis reveals that asymmetric bidirectional nonlinear causality exists between any market pair, and the degree of asymmetry appears to have declined after the 811 exchange rate regime reform. For the offshore RMB markets in the US, Europe, and UK, there is evidence of stronger causality running from the CNH to CNY than vice versa, which implies that the foreign impulses have had an influence on the domestic market, and the floating exchange rate reform effectively improves the RMB exchange rate formation mechanism.},

Focusing on the crown cantilever, the study analyzes the correlation between different monitoring indexes and damage indexes using DCCA correlation coefficient, and constructs a Random Forest prediction model based on time history information of indexes. Using this model, the paper predicts the volume ratio of damage for the crown cantilever over time and its maximum value, comparing the results with those obtained from a model based on maximum value information, through error analysis. The results of the correlation analysis indicate a close relationship between the increase in the maximum upstream displacement, maximum upstream acceleration, and the widening of the transverse joint opening width, and the development of damage in the monolith. The error analysis results demonstrate that the prediction network established based on time history information performs well in both point prediction and interval prediction.

  abstract = {In the last decade, the paradigm Historical Building Information Modeling (HBIM) was investigated to exploit the possibilities offered by the application of BIM to historical buildings. In the Cultural Heritage domain, the BIM-oriented approach can produce 3D models that are data collector populated by both geometrical and non-geometrical information related to various themes: historical documents, monitoring data, structural information, conservation or restoration state and so on. The realization of a 3D model fully interoperable and rich in its informative content could represent a very important change towards a more efficient management of the historical real estate. The work presented in these pages outlines a novel approach to solve this interoperability issue, by developing and testing a workflow that exploits the advantages of BIM platforms and Semantic-Web technologies, enabling the user to query a repository composed of semantically structured and rich HBIM data. The presented pipeline follows four main steps: (i) the first step consists on modeling an ontology with the main information needs for the domain of interest, providing a data structure that can be leveraged to inform the data-enrichment phase and, later, to meaningfully query the data. (ii) Afterwards, the data enrichment was performed, by creating a set of shared parameters reflecting the properties in our domain ontology. (iii) To structure data in a machine-readable format, a data conversion was needed to represent the domain (ontology) and analyze data of specific buildings respectively; this step is mandatory to reuse the analysis data together with the 3D model, providing the end-user with a querying tool. (iv) As a final step in our workflow, we developed a demonstrative data exploration web application based on the faceted browsing paradigm and allowing to exploit both structured metadata and 3D visualization. This research demonstrates how is possible to represent a huge amount of specialized information models with appropriate LOD and Grade in BIM environment and then guarantee a complete interoperability with IFC/RDF format. Relying on semantically structured data (ontologies) and on the Linked Data stack appears a valid approach for addressing existing information system issues in the CH domain and constitutes a step forward in the management of repositories and web libraries devoted to historical buildings.},

  abstract = {The evolutionary structural optimisation (ESO) method has been under continuous development since 1992. Traditionally, the method was conceived from the engineering perspective that the topology and shape of structures were naturally conservative for safety reasons and therefore contained an excess of material. To move from the conservative design to a more optimum design would therefore involve the removal of material. Thus the ESO method started from a design space much bigger than the optimum and the final topology or shape emerged by a process of removal of unwanted/inefficient/lowly stresses material. The original algorithms allowed for two forms of evolution. One was there the understressed material could be removed from anywhere in the allowable design space, and with compensation for checker-boarding this produces an optimum topology under the prescribed environments. The second form only allows removal from the surface or parts of the surface (called nibbling in the ESO lexicon); this produces a Min-Max situation where the maximum surface stress is reduced to a minimum. It has been demonstrated that the ESO process produces a surface that is an iso-stress contour thus satisfying the Min-Max optimality criterion. The present paper addresses the opposite evolutionary process whereby the structure evolves from a base which is the minimum structural form required to carry the load regardless of the magnitude of the stress levels. Material is added in the proximity of high stress to ameliorate its effect and hence the final structural form emerges. Only singly connected regions are formed in the present analysis and thus the additive ESO process is the opposite of the nibbling SO, mentioned above, that produces optimum surface shapes. The paper presents a brief background to the current state of structural optimisation research. This is followed by a discussion of the strategies for the additive ESO (AESO) algorithm and two examples are presented.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Alterations in narrow-\-band spectral power of electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are commonly reported in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). It is well established however that electrophysiological signals comprise a broadband scale-\- free (or fractal) component generated by mechanisms different from those producing oscillatory neural activity. Despite this known feature, it has not yet been investigated if spectral abnormalities found in SZ could be attributed to scale-\-free or oscillatory brain function. Methods: In this study, we analyzed resting-\-state EEG recordings of 14 SZ patients and 14 healthy controls. Scale-\-free and oscillatory components of the power spectral density (PSD) were separated, and band-\-limited power (BLP) of the original (mixed) PSD, as well as its fractal and oscillatory components, was estimated in five frequency bands. The scaling property of the fractal component was characterized by its spectral exponent in two distinct frequency ranges (1--\-13 and 13--\-30 Hz). Results: Analysis of the mixed PSD revealed a decrease of BLP in the delta band in SZ over the central regions; however, this difference could be attributed almost exclusively to a shift of power toward higher frequencies in the fractal component. Broadband neural activity expressed a true bimodal nature in all except frontal regions. Furthermore, both low-\- and high-\-range spectral exponents exhibited a characteristic topology over the cortex in both groups. Conclusion: Our results imply strong functional significance of scale-\-free neural activity in SZ and suggest that abnormalities in PSD may emerge from alterations of the fractal and not only the oscillatory components of neural activity.},

The difficulties posed by the multiple objectives which characterize architectural design problems are discussed and some solution approaches are described. The paper concludes that optimization concepts offer a powerful approach to design decision making and warrant much more research activity in the development of techniques and models for application in architecture.},

These devices generate the overwhelming volume of high-speed streaming data, termed as Big Data. However, the generation of city data at a remote location and then transmitting it to central city servers for analysis purpose raises the concerns of security and privacy. On the other hand, providing security to such Big Data streaming requires a high-speed security system that can work in a real-time environment without providing any delay that may slow down the overall performance of the Smart City System. To overthrown these challenges, in this paper, we proposed an efficient and real-time Smart City security system by providing strong intrusion detection at intelligent city building (ICB) and also a security protocol to protect the communication between the remote smart system(RSS)/User and the city analysis building, i.e., ICB. The proposed communication security protocol consists of various phases, i.e., registration phase, session key exchange phase, session key revocation phase, and data transmission phases from RSS to ICB as well as from User to ICB. Vast security analyses are performed to evaluate the credibility of the system. The proposed system is also evaluated on efficiency in terms of computation cost and throughput of overall functions used in the system. The system's evaluation and the comparative study with existing system show that the prosed system is secure, more efficient, and able to work in a real-time, high-speed Smart City environment.}

While a lot of work has already been carried out as to what these technologies will bring in terms of product and process innovation, little has been done on their impact on business models and business model innovation. Yet, history has shown that technological revolution without adequate business model evolution is a pitfall for many businesses. In the case of 3D printing, the matter is further complicated by the fact that adoption of these technologies has occurred in four successive phases (rapid prototyping, rapid tooling, digital manufacturing, home fabrication) that correspond to a different level of involvement of 3D printing in the production process. This article investigates the effect of each phase on the key business model components. While the impact of rapid prototyping and rapid tooling is found to be limited in extent, direct manufacturing and, even more so, home fabrication have the potential to be highly disruptive. While much more value can be created, capturing value can become extremely challenging. Hence, finding a suitable business model is critical. To this respect, this article shows that 3D printing technologies have the potential to change the way business model innovation is carried out, by enabling adaptive business models and by bringing the `rapid prototyping' paradigm to business model innovation itself.},

First, the cross-correlation analysis indicated that oil price--exchange rate correlations were negative and low, having in general lower values for longer time scales. Second, negative dependence between oil and the US dollar increased after the onset of the global financial crisis for all time scales, thereby providing evidence of both contagion and interdependence.

In this case, four specific channels were selected on the scalp: two on the frontal and two on parietal region. As a result, the DCCA multiple cross-correlation coefficient identified that there is a single signature for each subject. Globally, there is no significant difference between the real and the imaginary task. The frontal channels had greater multiple cross-correlation values than the parietal ones, especially for time scales around 0.42s, and with smaller standard deviations. According to our results, the proposal to study multiple time series at the same time by using the DCCA multiple cross-correlation coefficient is feasible and robust for EEG analysis. Finally, the coefficient was applied in a substantial number of subjects, tasks, and experiments producing high-quality results (figures, movies, and tables), and this study will probably kick off of a new approach to analyzing multiple cross-correlations in EEG signals.},

It was argued that the complexity of the behavior of cross-correlations is in line with the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH), which states that the behavior of the market participants evolves to adapt to changing market conditions. An interesting result is that cross-correlations are positive for early periods (from 1950 to late 2000s), and shifted to negative cross-correlations in the recent two decades, a transition that may be linked to changes in the long-term risk aversion of market participants.},

Lower co-movement of monetary policy is especially noticeable in the short run for EMEs. We further investigate the time-varying nature of such co-movements for the AEs by splitting the period (1980--2014) into four sub periods and also by performing a rolling window estimation for the entire period to reveal smoother dynamics. Significant evidence of higher monetary coordination is revealed for sub-periods with stronger trade and financial linkages.},

  abstract = {Large eddy simulations can provide very accurate predictions of the pressure exerted by the wind on a building. However, the assessment of transient flows using computational grids of high resolution is a computationally overwhelming task. Therefore, its use has been impracticable for most industrial applications, such as wind tunnel analysis. The recent technological developments along with alternative computational fluid dynamics paradigms might be able to change this scenario. Herein, we present results of high resolution LES using the lattice Boltzmann method. The LBM has a second-order accuracy of time and space and is highly localized. Hence the LBM has a very satisfactory precision and is extremely suitable for high performance GPU processing. Thereby engineering simulations can be performed overnight. The canonical case of a turbulent flow over a surface-mounted cube at Reynolds number 20,000 is assessed. Great performance and excellent agreement with experimental data for the pressure coefficient and its fluctuations are achieved.},

We present the three main theoretical frameworks that have been proposed for accounting for synchronization processes, (1) the information-processing approach, (2) the coupled oscillators model and (3) the complexity matching effect. We formally derive the WDCC results that could be expected from each model. We show by simulation that each model allows generating series that fit the expected results. We also analyze experimental data sets collected in situations that were supposed to selectively elicit the synchronization processes depicted in the three theoretical frameworks. Our results show that the information-processing and the complexity matching processes are both present in each situation, but with a clear dominance of one of these processes on the other. Finally our results lead us to cast some doubts about the relevance of the coupled oscillators model in interpersonal synchronization.},

  abstract = {Recently, GPS car navigation became popular enough for a significant number of drivers in any large city to be able to potentially send their current GPS positions and velocities to a central traffic-managing server in real time. This data could be used to reconstruct a map of current traffic in the whole city and make predictions for the future, which would be valuable for traffic control, congestion analysis and prevention. The difficulty lying in the traffic reconstruction problem is that the number of cars equipped with a GPS transmitter is a small in comparison with the total number of cars in the road network. Information obtained from GPS transmitters is therefore rare and incomplete, raising the problem of approximating travel velocities from sparse information. In this context, the paper proposes approaches to solving two problems: (1) of reconstruction of routes of the individual cars in a street graph from a temporal stream of its coordinates and (2) of approximating the average velocity on a given street from irregular time series of instantaneous velocities of cars passing through that street. Determining the car's position in the road network is quite expensive computationally when done in a naive way, so we propose a method to speed up the car's localization based on the R-tree data structure [10]. Additionally, a resilient propagation neural network [13] is applied to approximate the average velocity on any edge of a street graph. Our methods were applied to one of the problems announced in the competition organized in June 2010 by Tom-Tom - a company producing automotive navigation systems [15]. The results of experiments show the capacity of our approach to make useful predictions.},

In order to thoroughly examine the subject matter, this study takes a specific account of the symmetric and asymmetric effects of oil price changes in modelling process by utilizing innovative linear autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique and asymmetric nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) technique, which accommodate the short-run and long-run asymmetries via positive (increase) and negative (decrease) partial sum decompositions of oil price shocks. The result suggests that the variables are cointegrated, signifying the evidence of long and short run relationships of each country. Evidence of long and short run asymmetries is also confirmed in C{\^o}te d'Ivoire, Ghana and Senegal, suggesting that rising and declining oil price have different effect on exchange rate, while symmetric effect is observed in South Africa and Morocco. Rising oil price has positive effect on exchange rate in South Africa and Senegal leading to depreciation of exchange rate, while falling oil price leads to exchange rate appreciation of South Africa rand, Ghanaian cedi and Senegal francs but exchange rate depreciation of Moroccan dirham and Cote d'Ivoire francs. The result further suggests that negative decrease in oil price has a larger impact on exchange rate than the positive increase that varies in sign and size across countries. This suggests that oil price changes play a significance role that influence the behaviour of exchange rate and hence leading to contribute to the development of national economic progress.},

  abstract = {This study analyzes five years of 1-min solar global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI) observations obtained at Petrolina (northeast Brazil). Quality-assured hourly and daily averages are obtained after applying filters and methodologies based on a Baseline Solar Radiation Network (BSRN) quality-control procedure. To calculate correct hourly averages, a minimum fraction of 20\% of valid GHI or DNI minutely data is needed, as well as at least 60\% of valid days to calculate correct daily-mean monthly values. An asymmetric diurnal pattern is found in GHI and DNI during all months, attributed to consistently higher cloudiness in the morning. The quality-assured hourly and monthly-mean GHI and DNI time series are compared to estimates from 11 solar databases regularly used in solar resource assessment studies: CAMS, CERES, ERA5, INPE, MERRA-2, Meteonorm, NASA-POWER, NSRDB, SARAH, SWERA-BR, and SWERA-US. For hourly GHI values, a range of RMS differences is found between the best (CAMS, 17.3\%) and the worst (MERRA-2, 38.9\%) results. The latter database is also affected by a larger bias (18.7\%) than CAMS (4\%). Larger RMS differences are found with hourly DNI, in a range extending from 37\% (CAMS) to 63.4\% (ERA5). Biases are all above 12\%, except for CERES (-1\%). For long-term mean-monthly GHI results, low biases of less than 1\% are obtained with CAMS, CERES and NASA-POWER, whereas MERRA-2 overestimates (13\%). Larger biases are found for mean-monthly DNI, spanning between CAMS (3\%) and Meteonorm (-18.4\%). Overall, CAMS appears the most consistent solar database for long-term irradiance time series at Petrolina. The significant differences found here between modeled databases are larger than expected, and underline the importance of regional validation studies like this one to decrease the incidence of uncertainties in solar resource assessments on the design and performance of solar energy projects.},

Each music sample was divided into six parts and `multifractal spectral width' was determined for each part corresponding to the four samples. The results obtained reveal that different parts of all the four sound signals possess spectral width of widely varying values. This gives a cue of the so called `musical improvisation' in all music samples, keeping in mind they belong to the bandish part of the same raga. Formal compositions in Hindustani raga are juxtaposed with the improvised portions, where an artist manoeuvers his/her own creativity to bring out a mood that is specific for that particular performance, which is known as `improvisation'. Further, this observation hints at the association of different emotions even in the same bandish of the same raga performed by the same artist, this interesting observation cannot be revealed unless rigorous non-linear technique explores the nature of musical structure. In the second part, we applied MFDXA technique to explore more in-depth about `improvisation' and association with emotion. This technique is applied to find the degree of cross-correlation ({$\gamma$}x) between the different parts of the samples. Pronounced correlation has been observed in the middle parts of the all the four samples evident from higher values of {$\gamma$}x \hspace{0pt}whereas the other parts show weak correlation. This gets further support from the values of spectral width from different parts of the sample --- width of those parts is significantly different from other parts. This observation is extremely new both in respect of musical structure of so called improvisation and associated emotion. The importance of this study in application area of cognitive music therapy is immense.},

Identifying a variety of experiments in a closely related group, it refutes a commonly held scholarly assumption that Indian temples follow architectural norms ordained by India's religious traditions-an assumption fed by Western definitions of individuality and originality. These Karnataka temples demonstrate that their architects-while mostly unknown-fundamentally changed the formal as well as the conceptual basis of southern architecture they had inherited. Their formal choices, manipulating regional conventions as well as opening up their structures to include references from other regions, led to a new, consciously modern form of architecture whose modernity has been overlooked by scholars. Scholars have tended to call this new regional invention Vesara (Sanskrit "mule" or "hybrid"), defining it as a derivative style of temple created by mixing typical features of North Indian and South Indian architecture. The article traces the emergence of Vesara's conceptual logic in the eleventh century through architectural anomalies and daringly unprecedented play with the formal means of regional architecture, arguing that the makers of these temples exercised a level of inventiveness we have not been willing to credit them with so far.},

This research aims to model a vertical work of social interest. The modeling was based on the standards defined by NR 18. After the modeling was completed, the results were compared with the real scenario of the construction, aiming to assess incompatibilities with what is required by NR. For modeling, the software Revit, MS Project, and Naviswork were used. It was concluded that the work did not meet some aspects required by NR, in addition to a lack of projects, design errors, and execution problems. As for the site managers, it was evaluated that the use of BIM in their construction sites could bring benefits to their work and facilitate decision making.},

  abstract = {Civil construction has peculiar characteristics such as low communication between the designers and the site managers, in addition to a high turnover of construction workers, which creates difficulties to implement an effective safety culture. The emergence of technologies has contributed to the improvement of communication and security, an example is Building Information Modeling (BIM) that allows the computational modeling of the work, which provides detailed data of its progress even in the design phase. This research aims to model a vertical work of social interest. The modeling was based on the standards defined by NR 18. After the modeling was completed, the results were compared with the real scenario of the construction, aiming to assess incompatibilities with what is required by NR. For modeling, the software Revit, MS Project, and Naviswork were used. It was concluded that the work did not meet some aspects required by NR, in addition to a lack of projects, design errors, and execution problems. As for the site managers, it was evaluated that the use of BIM in their construction sites could bring benefits to their work and facilitate decision making.},

  abstract = {Many different techniques for measuring material appearance have been proposed in the last few years. These have produced large public datasets, which have been used for accurate, data-driven appearance modeling. However, although these datasets have allowed us to reach an unprecedented level of realism in visual appearance, editing the captured data remains a challenge. In this paper, we present an intuitive control space for predictable editing of captured BRDF data, which allows for artistic creation of plausible novel material appearances, bypassing the difficulty of acquiring novel samples. We first synthesize novel materials, extending the existing MERL dataset up to 400 mathematically valid BRDFs. We then design a large-scale experiment, gathering 56,000 subjective ratings on the high-level perceptual attributes that best describe our extended dataset of materials. Using these ratings, we build and train networks of radial basis functions to act as functionals mapping the perceptual attributes to an underlying PCA-based representation of BRDFs. We show that our functionals are excellent predictors of the perceived attributes of appearance. Our control space enables many applications, including intuitive material editing of a wide range of visual properties, guidance for gamut mapping, analysis of the correlation between perceptual attributes, or novel appearance similarity metrics. Moreover, our methodology can be used to derive functionals applicable to classic analytic BRDF representations. We release our code and dataset publicly, in order to support and encourage further research in this direction.},

We use multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) and multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DXA) to first investigate the relative efficiency of credit and stock markets and then evaluate the mutual interdependence between CDS-equity market pairs. The scaling exponents of the MF-DFA approach suggest that CDS markets are relatively more inefficient than their equity counterparts. However, Banks and Financial credit markets are relatively more efficient. Basic Materials (both CDS and equity indices) is the most inefficient sector of the US economy. The cross-correlation exponents obtained through MF-DXA also suggest that the relationship of the CDS and equity sectors within and across markets is multifractal for all pairs. Within the CDS market, Basic Materials is the most dependent sector, whereas equity market sectors can be divided into two distinct groups based on interdependence. The pair-wise dependence between Basic Materials sector CDSs and the equity index is also the highest. The degree of cross-correlation shows that the sectoral pairs of CDS and equity markets belong to a persistent cross-correlated series within selected time intervals.},

To minimize cost, reduce size, and increase the efficiency of PV systems, the use of transformerless PV grid-connected inverters has gained the interest of the residential market. This study describes the main challenges in transformerless topologies as well as provides a review on new single-phase grid-connected PV systems, which are categorized into six groups based on the number of switches required in the system. The basic operational principles of various schemes under the six categories of inverters are presented and compared in terms of leakage current, efficiency, strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, the proposed inverter structure and a compensation strategy for eliminating leakage current have been discussed followed by a comparative study with the available ones. Consequently, our proposed system has found noteworthy results in PSIM environment with a reduction in leakage current as compared with those in three other different topologies.},

  abstract = {The cross correlation between daily meteorological data and air pollution index (API) records in Nanjing during the past 12 years is studied by means of a detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA). In this study, we use statistical significance tests and power-law statistical tests to verify cross correlation between meteorological data and the API. Through calculating the DCCA cross correlation coefficient {$\rho$}DCCA, we intend to obtain a range of cross correlation levels between the meteorological data and the API at different time scales. Utilizing the multifractal detrended cross correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) and algorithm-multifractal cross correlation analysis (MF-CCA) proposed by O{\'s}wiecimka, we observe multifractal cross-correlation behavior between meteorological factors and the API. Our results show a cross correlation between meteorological factors and the API in Nanjing. The cross-correlation between diurnal temperature ranges and the API is persistent at studied time scales, while the cross correlations of wind speed, relative humidity, and precipitation with the API are anti-persistent at studied time scales. Next, a cross correlation of temperature with the API finds persistent cross correlation at smaller time scales, and anti-persistent cross-correlation at larger time scales; the cross correlation of atmospheric pressure with the API, however, results in anti-persistent cross correlation at smaller time scales, and persistent cross correlation at larger time scales. The MF-DCCA demonstrates that all underlying fluctuations have a weak multifractal nature where one scaling exponent is obtained. However, the MF-CCA suggests that some crossovers exist in the cross-correlation fluctuation function in terms of time scales of temperature and atmospheric pressure versus the API. The MF-CCA method is more subtle and suitable for reflecting the cross correlation of the two given time series. Compared with a traditional correlation analysis, the DCCA can uncover more cross-correlation information between API and meteorological factors. Therefore, the DCCA is also recommended as a comparatively reliable method for detecting the correlations between the API and meteorological data, and can also be useful for our understanding of the cross correlation between air quality and meteorological elements.},

The results show that DPCCA can uncover intrinsic cross-correlations between API and meteorological elements, and most of their interactional mechanisms can be explained.

More remarkable, we find that detrended cross-correlation analysis can present the cross-correlations between the fluctuations in two nonstationary time series, but this cross-correlation does not always fully reflect the interactional mechanism for the original time series. Despite this, DPCCA is recommended as a comparatively reliable method for revealing intrinsic cross-correlations between API and meteorological elements, and it can also be useful for our understanding of their interactional mechanisms.},

The results show that using TPCA, two principal components can reflect the variance of these series: primary pollutants (SO2, NO2, CO, PM2.5 and PM10) and secondary pollutants (e.g., O3). However, using NSPCA, three principal components can be determined to reflect the detrended variance of these series: 1) a mixture of primary and secondary pollutants, 2) primary pollutants and 3) secondary pollutants. Various approaches can obtain different principal components. This phenomenon is closely related to methods for calculating the cross-correlation between each of the air pollutants. NSPCA is a more applicable, reliable method for analyzing the principal components of a series in the presence of nonstationarity and for a long-range correlation than can TPCA. Moreover, using detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA), the cross-correlation between O3 and NO2 is negative at a short timescale and positive at a long timescale. In hourly timescales, O3 is negatively correlated with NO2 due to a photochemical interaction, and in daily timescales, O3 is positively correlated with NO2 because of the decomposition of O3. In monthly timescales, the cross-correlation between O3 with NO2 has similar performance to those of O3 with meteorological elements. DCCA is again shown to be more appropriate for disclosing the cross-correlation between series in the presence of nonstationarity than is Pearson's method. DCCA can improve our understanding of their interactional mechanisms.},

However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of ``unrolling'' an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this tutorial is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in Signal Processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the ``Vanilla LSTM''1 network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our new augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find the insights and derivations in this treatise valuable as well.},

The 15 years regular monitoring data from two general urban sites, Central/Western District and Tsuen Wan, are analyzed. The results show that the relationships between ambient dioxins and precipitation (or PM10) display long-term cross-correlation at the time scale ranging from one month to one year; while, no cross-correlation with each other have observed in longer temporal scaling regimes (greater than one year). Meantime, differentiated from the previous study, we found that precipitation has the greatest influence on ambient PCDD/PCDFs at the long-term time scaling (about one year) in Hong Kong. And no significant relationships are found between ambient dioxins and average temperature at long-term time scale. These results correspond to atmospheric circulation and regional transport hypothesis and are explained in detail. The long-term cross-correlation property is discussed further, considering the strong influence of the Asian monsoon system.},

Moreover, to illustrate the advantages of this approach we make use of the MM-DCCA to analyze the cross-correlation properties between financial time series. We show that this new method can be adapted to investigate stock markets under investigation. It can provide a more faithful and more interpretable description of the dynamic mechanism between financial time series than traditional MF-DCCA.

Using detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA), the relationship between air pollution and traffic congestion in the urban area of Chengdu was investigated. In order for a better quantification of the congested condition in a relatively large spatial region, a new measure, i.e., the congestion length (CL), is developed, extracted, and estimated using the Google Real-Time Traffic Maps and GIS technology. Relationships between the hourly average congestion length (HACL) and NO2 concentrations in the urban area of Chengdu from 12 May to 17 May, 2013 were analyzed. A high long-term cross-correlation between HACL and NO2 was observed, implying the ambient NO2 concentration fluctuations are positively cross-correlated with urban traffic congestion in the form of a power function. However, the ambient NO2 concentration did not respond immediately to the change of road traffic due to a relatively slow and lagged photochemical reaction process. A time lagged cross-correlation was further analyzed and showed that the time lag could be as large as 10h. These findings can be used for improving air quality forecasting accuracy by taking into account the time lags in correlation between emissions and air quality.},

  abstract = {In the Korean housing market, mass customization (MC) is an inevitable strategy for ensuring competitiveness. However, though customer needs have varied rapidly under the customer-oriented market conditions, the level of customization for houses has been restricted by economics of scale in the construction processes. With the rise of the level of customization, the cost of site management has increased because of additional labour. Therefore, this paper introduces the finishing information system (FIS), which can be used to minimize the additional commitment of manpower due to higher levels of MC. To illustrate and validate this system, a case study was performed in a real apartment complex project. The results showed that additional manpower for site management was decreased by quicker completion of the job, simplification of the management process, and efficiency of communication.},

Data are extracted from seven years (2008 to 2014) of hourly time series data in meteorological offices of the Korea Meteorological Administration. Using the detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) method, the DCCA coefficient of temperature is compared to that of humidity from daily time series data during four seasons in the four metropolitan cities. In particular, as window size s increases, the DCCA cross-correlation coefficient approaches 0.034 at a time lag of 14 days in the case of spring in Seoul. We find the weak cross-correlation between temperature and humidity at different time lags of 14, 21 and 28 days in spring in Seoul, and the errors ET in the ANN are relatively larger values than that of any other season in both the ANN and the MRM. Particularly, in the ANN model, there exist relatively a large error value of temperature as the characteristics of the non-stationary, deterministically chaotic and noisy meteorological data extracted for the short-term prediction rather than the long-term prediction.},

From an energy perspective during early architectural design, the refinement of design parameters by addition of information allows a more precise prediction of building performance. The need for energy-efficient buildings requires a designer to focus on the parameters in order of their ability to reduce uncertainty in energy performance to prioritise energy relevant decisions. However, there is no method for assigning and prioritising information for a particular level of multi-LOD. In this study, we performed a sensitivity analysis of energy models to estimate the uncertainty caused by the design parameters in energy prediction. This study allows to rank the design parameters in order of their influence on the energy prediction and determine the information required at each level of multi-LOD approach. We have studied the parametric energy model of different building shapes representing architectural design variation at the early design stage. A variance-based sensitivity analysis method is used to calculate the uncertainty contribution of each design parameter. The three levels in the uncertainty contribution by the group of parameters are identified which form the basis of information required at each level of multi-LOD BIM approach. The first level includes geometrical parameters, the second level includes technical specification and operational design parameters, and the third level includes window construction and system efficiency parameters. These findings will be specifically useful in the development of a multi-LOD approach to prioritise performance relevant decisions at early design phases.},

Interval analysis is used in a variety of algorithms to compute solutions to global problems and is an exhaustive technique as all regions of the problem's input space are examined for solutions. Convergent inclusion functions are a useful tool for the analysis of interval algorithms. The number of solutions to the constraint system is assumed to be the number of disjoint sets produced. This technique may be used heuristically or in combination with the condition for existence of a unique zero. A robust approach to the subproblem of obtaining all solutions to the constraint system is to use a robust test for solution existence in each aggregated region. Interval Newton methods are robust methods to find bounds on the set of zeroes of a system of n equations of n variables and are the interval analogs of multidimensional Newton iteration for the simultaneous solution of nonlinear equations.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study is to obtain globally optimum shapes for two-dimensional structures subject to quasi-static loads and restraints. For this purpose a technique is proposed, using which the volume (or weight) of a structure can be minimized. The emphasis is on how one can define the shape precisely, and find a shape that accurately reflects the globally optimum shape. As design constraints, stresses developed in the structure should not exceed the maximum allowable stress, and connectivity of the structure should not be lost during shape changes. Optimization is achieved by a stochastic search algorithm called direct simulated annealing (DSA), which seeks the global minimum through randomly generated configurations. In order to obtain random configurations, a boundary variation technique is used. In this technique, a set of key points is chosen and connected by cubic splines to describe the boundary of the structure. Whenever the positions of the key points are changed in random directions, a new shape is obtained. Thus, coordinates of the key points serve as design variables. In order to apply the optimization procedure, a general computer code was developed using ANSYS Parametric Design Language. A number of cases were examined to test its effectiveness. The results show that this technique can be applied to two-dimensional shape optimization problems with high reliability even for cases where the entire free boundary is allowed to vary. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The structure of Lispmakes it easy to extend the language or even to implement entirely new dialects without starting from scratch. Overall, the evolution of Lisp has been guided more by institutional rivalry, one-upsmanship, and the glee born of technical cleverness that is characteristic of the ``hacker culture'' than by sober assessments of technical requirements. Nevertheless this process has eventually produced both an industrial- strength programming language, messy but powerful, and a technically pure dialect, small but powerful, that is suitable for use by programming-language theoreticians. We pick up where McCarthy's paper in the first HOPL conference left off. We trace the development chronologically from the era of the PDP-6, through the heyday of Interlisp and MacLisp, past the ascension and decline of special purpose Lisp machines, to the present era of standardization activities. We then examine the technical evolution of a few representative language features, including both some notable successes and some notable failures, that illuminate design issues that distinguish Lisp from other programming languages. We also discuss the use of Lisp as a laboratory for designing other programming languages. We conclude with some reflections on the forces that have driven the evolution of Lisp.},

Understanding shapes, he says, is a useful way to understand what is possible in design.Shapes are devices for visual expression just as symbols are devices for verbal expression. Stiny develops a unified scheme that includes both visual expression with shapes and verbal expression with signs. The relationships -- and equivalencies -- between the two kinds of expressive devices make design comparable to other professional practices that rely more on verbal than visual expression. Design uses shapes while business, engineering, law, mathematics, and philosophy turn mainly to symbols, but the difference, says Stiny, isn't categorical. Designing is a way of thinking. Designing, Stiny argues, is calculating with shapes, calculating without equations and numbers but still according to rules. Stiny shows that the mechanical process of calculation is actually a creative process when you calculate with shapes -- when you can reason with your eyes, when you learn to see instead of count.The book takes the idea of design as calculation from mere heuristic or metaphor to a rigorous relationship in which design and calculation each inform and enhance the other. Stiny first demonstrates how seeing and counting differ when you use rules -- that is, what it means to calculate with your eyes -- then shows how to calculate with shapes, providing formal details. He gives practical applications in design with specific visual examples. The book is extraordinarily visual, with many drawings throughout -- drawings punctuated with words.

Throughout an evolutionary process, the system performs real-time adjustment of regressors in the MLR model according to currently active sensors. The performance of the proposed system has been evaluated in a case study of modeling the Bocac dam (at the Vrbas River located in the Republic of Srpska), whereby an MLR model of the dam displacements has been optimized for periods when the sensors were malfunctioning.

Trend and harmonic function were considered as the deterministic part identified based on SSA decomposition. Meanwhile, NN was intended to handle the nonlinearity relationship in the stochastic part. These two SSA-based hybrid models were contemplated to be more flexible than TLSAR and more applicable to the series with an intricate pattern.

Some of the highlights of these proposed methodologies are: {$\bullet$} The two hybrid methods proposed here are applicable to load data series and other time series data. {$\bullet$} The two hybrid methods handle the deterministic and the nonlinear stochastic pattern in the data. {$\bullet$} The two hybrid methods show a significant improvement to the single methods used separately and to other hybrid methods.},

  abstract = {In this paper, four simulated annealing based multiobjective algorithms - SMOSA, UMOSA, PSA and WMOSA have been used to solve multiobjective optimization of constrained problems with varying degree of complexity along with a new PDMOSA algorithm. PDMOSA algorithm uses a strategy of Pareto dominant based fitness in the acceptance criteria of simulated annealing and is improved. In all algorithms, the current solution explores its neighborhoods in a way similar to that of classical simulated annealing. The performance and computational cost for all algorithms have been studied. All algorithms are found to be quite robust with algorithmic parameters and are capable of generating a large number of well diversified Pareto-optimal solutions. The quality and diversification of Pareto-optimal solutions generated by all algorithms are found to be problem specific. The computational cost is least by WMOSA and is followed by PDMOSA. The algorithms are simple to formulate and require reasonable computational time. Hence, the simultaneous use of all algorithms is suggested to obtain a wider spectrum of efficient solutions. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The paper proposes a new simulated annealing (SA) based multiobjective optimization algorithm, called orthogonal simulated annealing (OSA) algorithm in this work. The OSA algorithm incorporates an orthogonal experiment design (OED) with a simulated annealing based multiobjective algorithm aiming to provide an efficient multiobjective algorithm. OED involves several experiments based on an orthogonal table and a fractional factorial analysis to extract intelligently the best combination of decision vectors making the classical SA to explore search space effectively, to enhance convergence, and to improve quality of solutions in the Pareto set. These benefits have been tested by comparing the performance of OSA with one state-of-the-art multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (NSGA2) and one classical simulated annealing based multiobjective algorithm (CMOSA) considering multiobjective problems of varying degrees of complexity. The obtained Pareto sets by these three algorithms have been tested using standard methods like measure C, hypervolume comparison, etc. Simulation results show that the performance of and CPU time required by these algorithms are problem dependent, and with some problems, the OSA algorithm outperforms the other two algorithms. In particular, the comparison between OSA and CMOSA suggests that around 70\% times OSA outperforms CMOSA and obtains a well diversified set of solutions. In addition, with some problems, OSA captures the Pareto fronts where CMOSA fails. Therefore, the development of OSA is noteworthy, and it provides an additional tool to solve multiobjective optimization problems. ?? Elsevier Ltd.},

This modification can reduce the chance of high stress concentration in a composite structure and also produce the geometry which is easy to fabricate using fabrication techniques currently available.

These properties of DCCA make it possible to improve the investment effect and more valuable to investigate the scale behaviors of portfolios. The minimum variance portfolio (MVP) model and the Mean--Variance (MV) model are used to evaluate the effectiveness of this improvement. Stability analysis shows the effect of two kinds of correlation matrices on the estimation error of portfolio weights.

  abstract = {Elements that constitute the built environment are vast and so are the independent systems developed to model its various aspects. Many of these systems have been developed under various assumptions and approaches to execute functions that are distinct, complementary or sometimes similar. Furthermore, these systems are ever increasing in number and often assume similar nomenclatures and acronyms, thereby exacerbating the challenges of understanding their peculiar functions, definitions and differences. The current societal demand to improve sustainability per\-formance through collaboration as well as whole-system and through-life thinking is driving the need to integrate independent systems associated with different aspects and scales of the built environment to deliver smart solutions and services that improve the well-being of citizens. The contemporary object-oriented digitization of real-world elements appears to provide a leeway for amalgamating the modelling systems of various domains in the built environment which we termed as built environment information modelling (BeIM). These domains include architecture, engineering, construction as well as urban planning and design. Applications such as building information modelling, geographic information systems and 3D city modelling systems are now being integrated for city modelling purposes. The various works directed at integrating these systems are examined, revealing that current research efforts on integration fall into three categories: (1) data/file conversion systems, (2) semantic mapping systems and (3) the hybrid of both. The review outcome suggests that good knowledge of these domains and how their respective systems operate is vital to pursuing holistic systems integration in the built environment.},

  abstract = {Region-level passenger demand prediction plays an important role in the coordination of travel demand and supply in the urban public transportation system. The complex urban road network structure leads to irregular shapes and arrangements of regions, which poses a challenge for capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of demand generated in different regions. In this study, we propose a multi-community spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (MC\_STGCN) framework to predict passenger demand at a multi-region level by exploring spatio-temporal correlations among regions. Specifically, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) is applied to encode the temporal correlation in regions into a vector. On the other hand, the spatial correlations among regions are encoded into two graphs through the graph convolutional network (GCN): geographically adjacent graph and functional similarity graph. Then, a prediction module based on the Louvain algorithm is used to accomplish the passenger demand prediction of multi-regions. The two real-world taxi order data collected in Shenzhen City and New York City are used in model validation and comparison. The numerical results show that the MC\_STGCN model outperforms both classical time-series prediction methods and deep learning approaches. Moreover, in order to better illustrate the superiority of the proposed model, we further discuss the improvement of prediction performance though spatio-temporal correlation modeling and analyzing, the effectiveness of community detection compared with random classification of regions, and the advantages of regional level prediction compared with grid-based prediction models.},

It contains a series of provocative design projects, and yet it is not just a design or graphic art book per se. Following the tradition of architecture as a conglomeration of various design fields - engineering, theory, art, and recently, computation - the challenge of this book is to present a concept that, like architecture, is a unifying theme for many diverse disciplines. An algorithm is not only a step-by-step problem-solving procedure, a series of lines of computer codes or a mechanistic linguistic expression, but is also an ontological construct with deep philosophical, social, design, and artistic repercussions. Consequently, this book presents many, various and often seemingly disparate points of view that lead to the establishment of one common theme; algorithmic architecture. Guides readers in the increasingly popular practice of using algorithms to solve complex design issues Demonstrates a technique used by many of the big name architecture firms, now cascading down to educational level Shows architects how to use algorithms to go beyond the mouse and transcend the factory set limitations of current 3D CAD software},

For example, despite the existence of several limitations, the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) continues to be used and studied in the literature. Recently, CAPM was estimated based on fractal regressions, making it possible to distinguish between short and long-time scales, with the possibility of supporting the fractal market hypothesis. In this paper, we use this approach and extend it by building a multi-scale portfolio and efficient frontiers and considering three different market stages: pre-crisis, crisis and post-crisis, applied to the Dow Jones Index and its components. The main results show different behaviors along the different market stages, with higher scale dependence in the crisis period, when compared, for example, with the post-crisis one. Furthermore, when analyzing the efficient frontiers, it is possible to identify an inverted U-shaped relation between return and risk in the pre-crisis period, a negative relationship in the crisis period and a positive (and expected) relationship in the post-crisis period. These results show the importance of this relationship for investors, in order to build their portfolios, but also for financial authorities, because the continuous monitoring of markets could help to prevent possible crisis.},

Based on the KarushKuhnTucker (KKT) necessary conditions, optimality criteria for finding solutions are established and then employed to develop a simple algorithm for one-material minimum mean compliance and compliant mechanism problems. The algorithm consists of sequentially moving iso-surface threshold (MIST) of chosen characteristic response function.

A number of decisions are to be taken, such as optimizing the displacement of UI items on the available screen space or selecting an adequate palette of colors. Therefore, the UI design process is iterative in nature, time consuming, and costly. Generative design, while keeping the centrality of human creativity, introduces a novel approach to assist humans in finding effective and esthetically convincing solutions. Meta-heuristics are a means to apply generative design in practice. We advocate the use of meta-heuristics to supporting different aspects of the UI design process.

  abstract = {Background: On January 21, 2020, the World Health Organization reported the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, which rapidly evolved to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, the virus has also rapidly spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries. Objective: The first aim of this study is to identify new emerging COVID-19 clusters over time and space (from January 21 to mid-May 2020) in Latin American, Caribbean, and African regions, using a prospective space--time scan measurement approach. The second aim is to assess the impact of real-time population mobility patterns between January 21 and May 18, 2020, under the implemented government interventions, measurements, and policy restrictions on COVID-19 spread among those regions and worldwide. Methods: We created a global COVID-19 database, of 218 countries and territories, merging the World Health Organization daily case reports with other measures such as population density and country income levels for January 21 to May 18, 2020. A score of government policy interventions was created for low, intermediate, high, and very high interventions. The population's mobility patterns at the country level were obtained from Google community mobility reports. The prospective space--time scan statistic method was applied in five time periods between January and May 2020, and a regression mixed model analysis was used. Results: We found that COVID-19 emerging clusters within these five periods of time increased from 7 emerging clusters to 28 by mid-May 2020. We also detected various increasing and decreasing relative risk estimates of COVID-19 spread among Latin American, Caribbean, and African countries within the period of analysis. Globally, population mobility to parks and similar leisure areas during at least a minimum of implemented intermediate-level control policies (when compared to low-level control policies) was related to accelerated COVID-19 spread. Results were almost consistent when regional stratified analysis was applied. In addition, worldwide population mobility due to working during high implemented control policies and very high implemented control policies, when compared to low-level control policies, was related to positive COVID-19 spread. Conclusions: The prospective space--time scan is an approach that low-income and middle-income countries could use to detect emerging clusters in a timely manner and implement specific control policies and interventions to slow down COVID-19 transmission. In addition, real-time population mobility obtained from crowdsourced digital data could be useful for current and future targeted public health and mitigation policies at a global and regional level.},

The multicriteria reliability-based optimization problem with unserviceability and collapse as the failure criteria is presented for different optimum design formulations. The optimization is performed by using the feasible directions method. It is concluded that multicriteria reliability-based optimization has substantial potential for application in optimal design of structural systems. {\copyright} 1985.},

  abstract = {In an effort to remedy the issue of stagnant labor productivity in the construction industry, Building Information Modeling was proposed in the late 80's as a new solution for streamlining the design and delivery process of construction projects. BIM is a digital representation of a building meant to serve all project participants as a repository of all relevant data throughout the project's lifecycle. Management of this data along with the collaborative nature of BIM has been shown to offer many potential benefits to those involved in the project. Despite the huge potential for increasing productivity as well as the overall efficiency of construction projects, the adoption of BIM throughout the industry has been observed as slower than expected. This paper explores and analyzes the various barriers hindering the widespread adoption of BIM throughout the industry as well as proposes methods for addressing them. The author then answers the question of who should be responsible for driving the adoption of BIM and how to effectively do it. Finally the author proposes areas of further research and development which will assist in achieving a more widespread adoption of BIM throughout the industry.},

The best individuals of each sub-population are migrated to neighboring ones after a certain number of epochs. An implementation of the algorithm is discussed and the performance is evaluated against a standard set of test functions.

Based on the detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA), we obtain that returns and trading volumes are long-range cross-correlated. The existence of multifractality in the cross-correlation between returns and trading volumes has been proven with the multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MFDCCA) algorithm. The multifractal analysis also confirms that returns and trading volumes have different degrees of multifractality. We further perform a cross-correlation statistic to verify whether the cross-correlation significantly exists between returns and trading volumes for CSI300 index futures. In addition, results of the test for lead-lag effect demonstrate that contemporaneous cross-correlation of return and trading volume series is stronger than cross-correlations of leaded or lagged series.},

The proposed D-MV hedge ratio is defined as the detrended covariance function between spot and futures returns divided by the detrended variance function of futures returns. Through the simulated and empirical analysis, we find that (i) the outcomes of the hedge ratio and the corresponding hedging effectiveness for the D-MV hedge ratio are diverse at different time scales, which can meet needs of various hedging participants with different hedging horizons; (ii) our proposed D-MV hedge ratio has a better hedging performance and a greater potential to determine the hedge ratio because its results of hedging effectiveness at most of time scales are better than those of the traditional MV hedge ratio; and (iii) as for the method of D-MV hedge ratio for different polynomial orders m in the fitting procedure, the D-MV-1 hedge ratio (i.e., the linear polynomial in the fitting procedure) has the best hedging capability for determining the hedge ratio.},

Predicting cellular traffic in modern metropolis is particularly challenging because of the tremendous temporal and spatial dynamics introduced by diverse user Internet behaviours and frequent user mobility citywide. In this paper, we characterize and investigate the root causes of such dynamics in cellular traffic through a big cellular usage dataset covering 1.5 million users and 5,929 cell towers in a major city of China. We reveal intensive spatiotemporal dependency even among distant cell towers, which is largely overlooked in previous works. To explicitly characterize and effectively model the spatio-temporal dependency of urban cellular traffic, we propose a novel decomposition of in-cell and inter-cell data traffic, and apply a graph-based deep learning approach to accurate cellular traffic prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art time-series based approaches and we also show through an example study how the decomposition of cellular traffic can be used for event inference.},

Statistical tests are used to detect the nonlinear auto-correlated structures and long-range cross-correlations of the three time series. The multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis and multifractal spectrum analysis methods are applied, by which the existence of multifractality in these three return series are revealed and the sources of multifractality are explored. In particular, the multiscale multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis method is employed for the first time to generate the Hurst surfaces, which can be used to visualize the dynamic behaviors of cross-correlations among the markets. Empirical results show that the cross-correlations among the markets present different fractal features at different time scales. Further, our study finds that the correlation between the stock and fund markets is stronger than that of the other two groups, and the correlation between the stock and bond markets is unstable. These findings can help to better understand the dynamic mechanisms that govern the volatility of security markets and aid in performing better financial risk assessment and management.},

  abstract = {Recently, based on analogous height cross-correlation analysis (AHXA), a cross-correlation coefficient {$\rho\times$}(L) has been proposed to quantify the levels of cross-correlation on different temporal scales for bivariate series. A limitation of this coefficient is that it cannot capture the full information of cross-correlations on amplitude of fluctuations. In fact, it only detects the cross-correlation at a specific order fluctuation, which might neglect some important information inherited from other order fluctuations. To overcome this disadvantage, in this work, based on the scaling of the qth order covariance and time delay L, we define a two-parameter dependent cross-correlation coefficient {$\rho$}q(L) to detect and quantify the range and level of cross-correlations. This new version of {$\rho$}q(L) coefficient leads to the formation of a {$\rho$}q(L) surface, which not only is able to quantify the level of cross-correlations, but also allows us to identify the range of fluctuation amplitudes that are correlated in two given signals. Applications to the classical ARFIMA models and the binomial multifractal series illustrate the feasibility of this new coefficient {$\rho$}q(L). In addition, a statistical test is proposed to quantify the existence of cross-correlations between two given series. Applying our method to the real life empirical data from the 1999--2000 California electricity market, we find that the California power crisis in 2000 destroys the cross-correlation between the price and the load series but does not affect the correlation of the load series during and before the crisis.},

The sources of multifractality in three AQI time series are all from long-range correlations and fat tail distributions, although the highlighted sources are different in three cities.

O3 has an important impact on air quality in Beijing and Jinan city and NO2 has an important impact on air quality in Zhengzhou city. It is noted that PM2.5 has not as large an impact as we imagine in three cities.

Metrics such as Hurst exponents, scaling exponents, and multifractal spectrums show that the multifractal characteristics of both the time series pairs are significant. In addition, we compare the degrees of multifractal spectrums and find that the cross-correlation of the time series pair PM10/Bronchitis is stronger than that of PM10/Rhinitis, which indicates that the monthly outpatient quantity of bronchitis is more sensitive to PM10 concentration. Furthermore, to identify the main source of multifractality for two time series pairs, we phase-randomize and shuffle the original series. The computational results demonstrate that fat-tailed distribution contributes to the multifractality between respiratory diseases and haze.},

Meanwhile, as a powerful optimization tool for the applications' performance under the framework of ITS, the traffic prediction model has gained much attention. The traffic prediction model belongs to the traditional time series prediction model, widely used in industry for business analysis, abnormalities detection, etc. There are two main categories of traffic prediction models --- the parametric model and the non-parametric model. The non-parametric model develops rapidly in recent years due to the machine learning theory's maturing and increment in computing power. Compared to the parametric model, the non-parametric model is more accurate and requires less advanced analysis of traffic patterns' correlation, and can better handle a large amount of historical data. However, the non-parametric model also requires more powerful devices for training and implementation. The traffic prediction system's implementation environment, built by on-road resources and off-road infrastructures, is relatively limited compared to the traditional data center. This paper uses several well-known state-of-the-art non-parametric models and their Deep Learning structures for traffic prediction, and evaluates the models' performance on both freeway and urban-road dataset. Focusing on the model's accuracy and training cost while deploying prediction models in a large-scale traffic network, this paper provides a novel optimized training strategy called CTS to reduce the implementation cost of a complex inner structure model. This approach could be further used to reduce the deployment cost, especially the training time, for the big data intelligent system using machine learning.},

To effectively study their fractal properties, in this work, we first generalize the adaptive fractal analysis (AFA) to the adaptive multifractal cross-correlation analysis (AMFCCA), which can be used to study the multifractal cross-correlation between two time series. Considering the complexity of time series from complex systems, we extend AMFCCA to the case of multivariate time series, namely multivariate adaptive multifractal cross-correlation analysis (MV-AMFCCA). In order to detect multiscale multifractality, we propose multiscale multivariate adaptive multifractal cross-correlation analysis (MMV-AMFCCA). By the numerical simulation on synthetic multivariate processes, our method shows the theoretical validity. Furthermore, we applied these methods to the multifractal analysis of three pollutants in urban and suburban areas in Beijing. After removing the seasonal trend, we find that the urban and suburban systems both have multifractality, especially the multifractality of the urban system are more evident than the suburban systems, and the degree of multifractality in spring and winter stronger than that in summer and autumn. Therefore, our methods are suitable for systems with multiple outputs and provide more comprehensive methods for characterizing multivariate autocorrelation and cross-correlation.},

It well solves the dependence among the nonstationary variates while classic multivariate linear regression dose not. The real-world applications demonstrate its versatility and robustness. However, the statistical significance of this new model needs to be further improved mathematically not just empirically. Hence, the main motivation of this paper is to provide a solid theoretical basis for the latest regression framework. Specifically, four propositions and three theorems are deduced theoretically to support the statistical significance test of detrending-moving-average-based multivariate linear regression model. These propositions and theorems revolve around hypothesis testing of each partial regression coefficients and regression model. They can examine the statistical significance at every given scales. Moreover, we also resort to synthetic time series to verify the performances of the proposed statistical test procedure. By using those statistical tests, we investigate the multiscale interdependence between the crude oil price and the exchange rates among oil-importing and oil-exporting countries. Some interesting findings show that the dependent behavior between the oil price and exchange rates varies at various scales, which cannot be achieved from classical multivariate regression model.},

It is shown that in most of the cases the tails of return distributions of the considered financial instruments follow the inverse cubic power law. The only exception is the Russian ruble for which the distribution tail is heavier and scales with the exponent close to 2. From the perspective of multiscaling the analysed time series reveal the multifractal organization with the left-sided asymmetry of the corresponding singularity spectra. Even more, all the considered financial instruments appear to be multifractally cross-correlated with oil, especially on the level of medium-size fluctuations, as the multifractal cross-correlation analysis carried out by means of the multifractal cross-correlation analysis (MFCCA) and detrended cross-correlation coefficient {$\rho$}q show. The degree of such cross-correlations is however varying among the financial instruments. The strongest ties to the oil characterize currencies of the oil extracting countries. Strength of this multifractal coupling appears to depend also on the oil market trend. In the analysed time period the level of cross-correlations systematically increases during the bear phase on the oil market and it saturates after the trend reversal in 1st half of 2016. The same methodology is also applied to identify possible causal relations between considered observables. Searching for some related asymmetry in the information flow mediating cross-correlations indicates that it was the oil price that led the Russian ruble over the time period here considered rather than vice versa.},

  abstract = {Modern financial markets are characterized by a rapid flow of information, a vast number of participants having diversified investment horizons, and multiple feedback mechanisms, which collectively lead to the emergence of complex phenomena, for example speculative bubbles or crashes. As such, they are considered as one of the most complex systems known. Numerous studies have illuminated stylized facts, also called complexity characteristics, which are observed across the vast majority of financial markets. These include the so-called ``fat tails'' of the returns distribution, volatility clustering, the ``long memory'', strong stochasticity alongside non-linear correlations, persistence, and the effects resembling fractality and even multifractality. The striking development of the cryptocurrency market over the last few years -- from being entirely peripheral to capitalizing at the level of an intermediate-size stock exchange -- provides a unique opportunity to observe its evolution in a short period. The availability of high-frequency data allows conducting advanced statistical analysis of fluctuations on cryptocurrency exchanges right from their birth up to the present day. This opens a window that allows quantifying the evolutionary changes in the complexity characteristics which accompany market emergence and maturation. The purpose of the present review, then, is to examine the properties of the cryptocurrency market and the associated phenomena. The aim is to clarify to what extent, after such an impetuous development, the characteristics of the complexity of exchange rates on the cryptocurrency market have become similar to traditional and mature markets, such as stocks, bonds, commodities or currencies. The review introduces the history of cryptocurrencies, offering a description of the blockchain technology behind them. Differences between cryptocurrencies and the exchanges on which they are traded have been consistently shown. The central part of the review surveys the analysis of cryptocurrency price changes on various platforms. The statistical properties of the fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market have been compared to the traditional markets. With the help of the latest statistical physics methods, namely, the multifractal cross-correlation analysis and the q-dependent detrended cross-correlation coefficient, the non-linear correlations and multiscale characteristics of the cryptocurrency market are analyzed. In the last part of this paper, through applying matrix and network formalisms, the co-evolution of the correlation structure among the 100 cryptocurrencies having the largest capitalization is retraced. The detailed topology of cryptocurrency network on the Binance platform from bitcoin perspective is also considered. Finally, an interesting observation on the Covid-19 pandemic impact on the cryptocurrency market is presented and discussed: recently we have witnessed a ``phase transition'' of the cryptocurrencies from being a hedge opportunity for the investors fleeing the traditional markets to become a part of the global market that is substantially coupled to the traditional financial instruments like the currencies, stocks, and commodities. The main contribution is an extensive demonstration that, fueled by the increased transaction frequency, turnover, and the number of participants, structural self-organization in the cryptocurrency markets has caused the same to attain complexity characteristics that are nearly indistinguishable from the Forex market at the level of individual time-series. However, the cross-correlations between the exchange rates on cryptocurrency platforms differ from it. The cryptocurrency market is less synchronized and the information flows more slowly, which results in more frequent arbitrage opportunities. The methodology used in the review allows the latter to be detected, and lead--lag relationships to be discovered. Hypothetically, the methods for describing correlations and hierarchical relationships between exchange rates presented in this review could be used to construct investment portfolios and reduce exposure to risk. A new investment asset class appears to be dawning, wherein the bitcoin assumes the role of the natural base currency to trade.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the complex/multifractal organization of the brain signals is crucial to fully understanding the brain processes and structure. In this contribution, we performed the multifractal analysis of the electroencephalographic (EEG) data obtained from a controlled multiple sclerosis (MS) study, focusing on the correlation between the degree of multifractality, disease duration, and disability level. Our results reveal a significant correspondence between the complexity of the time series and multiple sclerosis development, quantified respectively by scaling exponents and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Namely, for some brain regions, a well-developed multifractality and little persistence of the time series were identified in patients with a high level of disability, whereas the control group and patients with low EDSS were characterized by persistence and monofractality of the signals. The analysis of the cross-correlations between EEG signals supported these results, with the most significant differences identified for patients with EDSS {\textquestiondown}1 and the combined group of patients with EDSS {$\leq$}1 and controls. No association between the multifractality and disease duration was observed, indicating that the multifractal organization of the data is a hallmark of developing the disease. The observed complexity/multifractality of EEG signals is hypothetically a result of neuronal compensation -- i.e., of optimizing neural processes in the presence of structural brain degeneration. The presented study is highly relevant due to the multifractal formalism used to quantify complexity and due to scarce resting-state EEG evidence for cortical reorganization associated with compensation.},

Two VaR backtesting techniques are then employed to compare the performance of the model with that of a group of linear and nonlinear generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. The empirical results show the multifractal nature of price volatility in Chinese stock market.

  abstract = {Although IP multicast has been proposed and investigated for years, there are major problems inherent in the IP multicasting technique, e.g. difficulty to scale up the system, difficulty in allocating a globally unique multicast address, complexity in supporting higher level features such as reliable data transfer and congestion/flow control, more importantly, difficulty to deploy on the current Internet infrastructure due to necessity to change many core routers. Recently, end-system multicast (ESM) has been proposed as an alternative solution so that multicasting services can be quickly deployed. In this paper, we consider the 'architectural' and 'optimization' issues on designing an ESM-tree. Specifically, we present a distributed algorithm on how to create and maintain an ESM-tree. We propose a distributed algorithm to perform tree optimization (TO) so that an ESM-tree can dynamically adapt to the changing network condition (e.g. drop in transfer bandwidth) so that the nodes within an ESM-tree can receive data more efficiently. The distributed algorithm has the important theoretical properties that at all times, a tree topology can be maintained and any node joining, leaving, as well as any TO operation will not 'partition' the underlying ESM-tree. Therefore, our work can be used to provide an efficient architectural infrastructure for ESM services. We have implemented a prototype ESM system and carried out experiments to illustrate the effectiveness and the performance gains of our ESM optimization protocol. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We present functional spaces and their adjacencies in form of graphs and propose an EA called EvoArch that works with a graph-encoding scheme. EvoArch encodes topological configuration in the adjacency matrices of the graphs that they represent and its reproduction operators operate on these adjacency matrices. In order to explore the large search space of graph topologies, these reproduction operators are designed to be unbiased so that all nodes in a graph have equal chances of being selected to be swapped or mutated. To evaluate the fitness of a graph, EvoArch makes use of a fitness function that takes into consideration preferences for adjacencies between different functional spaces, budget and other design constraints. By means of different experiments, we show that EvoArch can be a very useful tool for architectural layout design tasks. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the architecture, engineering and construction sector, cloud-BIM integration is considered to be the second generation of building information management (BIM) development, and is expected to produce another wave of change across the construction industry. Despite this, few studies to date have attempted to summarise the research literature on cloud-BIM. This paper explores the literature to identify the substantive work on cloud-BIM, particularly regarding building life cycle management, to provide valuable insight for practitioners and to propose avenues for further research. Thirty academic sources, including refereed journal articles and conference papers, were retrieved and analysed in terms of their research focus and nature of application. The review revealed that most cloud-BIM research has focused on the building planning/design and construction stages. The findings suggest that more research should be directed towards operation, maintenance and facility management, energy efficiency and the demolition and deconstruction stages of building life cycle management. Further empirical research on organisational and legal issues, including security, responsibility, liability and model ownership, of the cloud-BIM model is also needed},

In this approach, a Gaussian decay-based function is selected as a weighting function. An appropriate bandwidth is selected using an alternative criterion. Some factors influencing the local cross-correlation degree, including long-range exponent estimated by means of a detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and seasonal change in the series, are discussed. Artificial and real-world datasets are analyzed. The results show that the proposed method can measure the degree of a locally intrinsic cross-correlation between two series. The contribution of this locally intrinsic cross-correlation is attributed to original input excitation sources and DFA scaling exponents. The effects of seasonal change with a high-frequency in the series on a locally intrinsic cross-correlation are significant. The effects of a low-frequency seasonal change are insignificant. A positive local cross-correlation between a synchronous wind speed and air pollution index series in Nanjing, China is observed, which is related to externally imported air pollution sources. Consistent results are obtained by comparing the new method with the detrended cross-correlation coefficient{$\rho$}DCCA. Therefore, the proposed approach is reliable, reasonable, and applicable, and can examine the degree of the local intrinsic cross-correlation between two nonstationary time series.},

Results show that the proposed W-MFSMXA method not only keep the multifractal structure unchanged, but contains more significant information of series compared to the previous MFSMXA method. Furthermore, analytic formulas of the binomial multifractal model are generated for W-MFSMXA. Theoretical analysis and finite-size effect test demonstrate that W-MFSMXA slightly outperforms MFSMXA for relatively shorter series. We further generate the scaling exponent ratio to describe the relation of two methods, whose profile is found approximating a centrosymmetric hyperbola.

However, in practice, most of the GIS models are relatively poorly attributed, semantically. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is a process involving the generation and management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics of building, which is most used in small scale projects. In order to address the target problem of completing the semantic attribution of 3D digital city model, a framework of integrating BIM technology into GIS is demonstrated. A new concept of city information modeling (CIM) is proposed with the goal of bringing great benefits to the urban construction and city management. The composition of city information model is discussed. The data schema behind BIM and GIS (i.e. IFC and CityGML) are compared and mapped with each other.

The cross-correlation analysis of the flow structures is of significance for uncovering the nonlinear dynamics of the oil-water flows. In this study, we first employ a detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) method to investigate the cross-correlation characteristics of two series generated by two-component ARFIMA processes with an adjustable coupling strength. On this basis, to avoid spuriously high cross-correlations caused by noises, we conduct an anti-noise study applying a detrended partial cross-correlation analysis (DPCCA) to ARFIMA processes mixed with periodic signal, stochastic signal and chaotic signal, respectively. It's found that the DPCCA can effectively reveal the intrinsic cross-correlations of coupled series. Through carrying out an experiment of horizontal oil-water two-phase flows, the upstream and downstream flow information is collected by a conductance cross-correlation velocity probe. The DPCCA algorithm is used to calculate the multi-scale cross-correlation coefficient of the upstream and downstream flow structures. The results indicate that the DPCCA cross-correlation coefficient is very sensitive to the dynamics of the oil-water interfacial wave and the entrained droplets, and can serve as an effective indicator of horizontal oil-water two-phase flow structures.},

  abstract = {Traffic forecasting has attracted considerable attention due to its importance in proactive urban traffic control and management. Scholars and engineers have exerted considerable efforts in improving the performance of traffic forecasting algorithms in terms of accuracy, reliability, and efficiency. Spatial feature representation of traffic flow is a core component that greatly influences traffic forecasting performance. In previous studies, several spatial attributes of traffic flow are ignored due to the following issues: a) traffic flow propagation does not comply with the road network, b) the spatial pattern of traffic flow varies over time, and c) single adjacent matrix cannot handle the complex and hierarchical urban traffic flow. To address the abovementioned issues, this study proposes a novel traffic forecasting algorithm called traffic transformer, which achieves great success in natural language processing. The multihead attention mechanism and stacking layers enable the transformer to learn dynamic and hierarchical features in sequential data. Two components, namely, global encoder and global-local decoder, are proposed to extract and fuse the spatial patterns globally and locally. Experimental results indicate that the proposed traffic transformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The learned dynamic and hierarchical features of traffic flow can help achieve a better understanding of spatial dependency of traffic flow for effective and efficient traffic control and management strategies.},

This paper proposes a new deep learning model named TmS-GCN to predict region-level traffic information, which is composed of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The GCN part captures spatial dependence among regions, while the GRU part captures the dynamic change of traffic within the region.

  abstract = {Although reliability-based structural optimization (RBSO) is recognized as a rational structural design philosophy that is more advantageous to deterministic optimization, most common RBSO is based on straightforward two-level approach connecting algorithms of reliability calculation and that of design optimization. This is achieved usually with an outer loop for optimization of design variables and an inner loop for reliability analysis. A number of algorithms have been proposed to reduce the computational cost of such optimizations, such as performance measure approach, semi-infinite programming, and mono-level approach. Herein the sequential approximate programming approach, which is well known in structural optimization, is extended as an efficient methodology to solve RBSO problems. In this approach, the optimum design is obtained by solving a sequence of sub-programming problems that usually consist of an approximate objective function subjected to a set of approximate constraint functions. In each sub-programming, rather than direct Taylor expansion of reliability constraints, a new formulation is introduced for approximate reliability constraints at the current design point and its linearization. The approximate reliability index and its sensitivity are obtained from a recurrence formula based on the optimality conditions for the most probable failure point (MPP). It is shown that the approximate MPP, a key component of RBSO problems, is concurrently improved during each sub-programming solution step. Through analytical models and comparative studies over complex examples, it is illustrated that our approach is efficient and that a linearized reliability index is a good approximation of the accurate reliability index. These unique features and the concurrent convergence of design optimization and reliability calculation are demonstrated with several numerical examples.},

We use daily maximum and minimum air temperature at 590 Chinese meteorological stations in recent 46 years. Before estimating trends in daily air temperature, we filter out the periodic component by removing the mean record for each calendar date. With considering the LRC effect, we extract the observed trends in both daily maximum and minimum air temperature, test their significance, and compare the results to those obtained by the traditional linear regression which ignores the LRC effect. It is substantiated that by inflating the estimation uncertainty LRC can increase the chance of the observed trends to be insignificant by about 4 times and 10 times for daily maximum and minimum air temperature at Chinese stations, respectively. In addition, the observed trends in daily minimum air temperature are found to be much more significant than those in the daily maximum records. With consideration of the LRC effect, we apply a method proposed by Rybski and Bunde (2009) based on the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) to estimate the most-likely trend in temperature at five representative stations (Tianjin, Hohhot, Nanjing, Haikou, and Xining), which correspond to the five typical climate in China, i.e., temperate monsoon climate, temperate continental climate, subtropical monsoon climate, tropical monsoon climate, and plateau mountain climate, respectively. Comparing to the DFA-based method, it is demonstrated that the traditional linear regression may overestimate the most-likely trends at these five stations by more than 100},

Contributed by the ever-increasing real-time demand on the transportation system, especially small-parcel last-mile delivery requests, vehicle route generation is becoming more computationally complex than before. The existing routing algorithms are mostly based on mathematical programming, which requires huge computation time in city-size transportation networks. To develop routes with minimal time, in this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning-based neural combinatorial optimization strategy. Specifically, we transform the online routing problem to a vehicle tour generation problem, and propose a structural graph embedded pointer network to develop these tours iteratively. Furthermore, since constructing supervised training data for the neural network is impractical due to the high computation complexity, we propose a deep reinforcement learning mechanism with an unsupervised auxiliary network to train the model parameters. A multisampling scheme is also devised to further improve the system performance. Since the parameter training process is offline, the proposed strategy can achieve a superior online route generation speed. To assess the proposed strategy, we conduct comprehensive case studies with a real-world transportation network. The simulation results show that the proposed strategy can significantly outperform conventional strategies with limited computation time in both static and dynamic logistic systems. In addition, the influence of control parameters on the system performance is investigated.},

Deep learning technologies were recently introduced to traffic forecasting in order to accommodate the spatio-temporal dependencies among traffic states. In the present study, we devised a novel graph-based neural network that expanded the existing graph convolutional neural network (GCN). The proposed model allowed us to differentiate the intensity of connecting to neighbor roads, unlike existing GCNs that give equal weight to each neighbor road. A plausible model architecture that mimicked real traffic propagation was established based on the graph convolution. The domain knowledge was efficiently incorporated into a neural network architecture. The present study also employed a generative adversarial framework to ensure that a forecasted traffic state could be as realistic as possible considering the joint probabilistic density of real traffic states. The forecasting performance of the proposed model surpassed that of the original GCN model, and the estimated adjacency matrices revealed the hidden nature of real traffic propagation.},

After a statistical significance test, spatial cross-correlation patterns on different time scales are shown in this paper. We find the spatial cross-correlation patterns can vary with time scales. On small time scale of one week to one month, only the temperatures in nearby regions have close relations with that in Beijing, while on larger time scale of intra or inter-seasonal, temperatures in most of the regions, especially in the northeast show high level cross-correlations with that in Beijing. The southwest plateau (including the Tibetan Plateau and the YunGui Plateau) is a special region, where the temperatures take on significant anti-cross-correlations on inter-seasonal scale, but no significant correlations on inter-annual scale. By analyzing these different spatial patterns, we can better understand the influencing climatological processes of different scales. Therefore, DCCA are recommended as a reliable method in detecting the relations between two climatological variables, and further be useful for our understanding of the whole climate system.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In this paper, a new method, detrended partial-cross-correlation analysis (DPCCA), is proposed. Based on detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA), this method is improved by including partial-correlation technique, which can be applied to quantify the relations of two non-stationary signals (with influences of other signals removed) on different time scales. We illustrate the advantages of this method by performing two numerical tests. Test I shows the advantages of DPCCA in handling non-stationary signals, while Test II reveals the ``intrinsic'' relations between two considered time series with potential influences of other unconsidered signals removed. To further show the utility of DPCCA in natural complex systems, we provide new evidence on the winter-time Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the winter-time Nino3 Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly (Nino3-SSTA) affecting the Summer Rainfall over the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River (SRYR). By applying DPCCA, better significant correlations between SRYR and Nino3-SSTA on time scales of 6 {\textasciitilde} 8 years are found over the period 1951 {\textasciitilde} 2012, while significant correlations between SRYR and PDO on time scales of 35 years arise. With these physically explainable results, we have confidence that DPCCA is an useful method in addressing complex systems.},

We apply the Wavelet Correlation Breakdown test to observe any abrupt changes in spot-futures correlation before and after 2010. We then use the spectrogram by Wavelet Power and Energy Spectrum to approximate the duration of spot and futures volatility caused by the financial contagion. The Wavelet Correlation Breakdown tests' results confirm the existence of financial contagion in the futures markets.

We utilized the Physionet on-line databank, a publicly available database of human EEG signals, as a standardized reference database for this study. Herein, we report the use of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method for EEG analysis. We show that the complex time series of the EEG exhibits characteristic fluctuations depending on the analyzed channel in the scalp-recorded EEG. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique, we analyzed four distinct channels represented here by F332, F637 (frontal region of the head) and P349, P654 (parietal region of the head). We verified that the amplitude of the FDFA rms function is greater for the frontal channels than for the parietal. To tabulate this information in a better way, we define and calculate the difference between FDFA (in log scale) for the channels, thus defining a new path for analysis of EEG signals. Finally, related to the studied EEG signals, we obtain the auto-correlation exponent, {$\alpha$}DFA by DFA method, that reveals self-affinity at specific time scale. Our results shows that this strategy can be applied to study the human brain activity in EEG processing.},

In the pandemic times of COVID-19, our results show that taking into account the DFA method, for time-scale shorter than 5 days, the stock markets tend to be efficient, whereas for time-scale longer than 10 days, the stock market tend to be inefficient.

Firstly, the proposed MSDE is validated with Lorenz system and ARFIMA processes. Interestingly, it is found that the MSDE is dramatically associated with the cross-correlations of the coupled time series. Then, through conducting the experiment of horizontal oil--water two-phase flows, the upstream and downstream flow information is collected using a conductance cross-correlation velocity probe. The coupled cross-correlated signals are investigated using the MSDE method, and the results indicate that the MSDE is an effective tool uncovering the complex dynamic behaviors of flow pattern transitions.},

We use the multifractal detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-DCCA) to analyze the cross-correlations, and study further the asymmetric characteristics of cross-correlations by multifractal asymmetric detrended cross-correlation analysis (MF-ADCCA). The experimental results show that the cross-correlations between PM2.5 concentration and four meteorological factors are multifractal and anti-persistent, and the strength of multifractality of Beijing is stronger than that of Hong Kong. Meanwhile, the cross-correlations between PM2.5 concentration and meteorological factors are asymmetric, and the asymmetric cross-correlations are multifractal.},

The exclusion process, one of interacting particle systems, is usually thought of as modeling particle motion (with the conserved number of particles) in a continuous time Markov process. In this work, the process is utilized to imitate the trading interactions among the investing agents, in order to explain some stylized facts found in financial time series dynamics. To better understand the correlation behaviors of the proposed model, a new time-dependent intrinsic detrended cross-correlation (TDI-DCC) is introduced and performed, also, the autocorrelation analyses are applied in the empirical research. Furthermore, to verify the rationality of the financial price model, the actual return series are also considered to be comparatively studied with the simulation ones. The comparison results of return behaviors reveal that this financial price dynamics model can reproduce some correlation features of actual stock markets.},

Scaling analysis demonstrates that multifractality exists in cross-correlations, and the cross-correlation coefficients after the SHSCP are larger than those before the SHSCP. Moreover, an analysis of the origin of multifractality indicates that long-range correlation and fat-tailed distribution play important roles in the contributions of multifractality.

The unique capability of graphs enables capturing the structural relations among data, and thus allows to harvest more insights compared to analyzing data in isolation. However, it is often very challenging to solve the learning problems on graphs, because (1) many types of data are not originally structured as graphs, such as images and text data, and (2) for graph-structured data, the underlying connectivity patterns are often complex and diverse. On the other hand, the representation learning has achieved great successes in many areas. Thereby, a potential solution is to learn the representation of graphs in a low-dimensional Euclidean space, such that the graph properties can be preserved. Although tremendous efforts have been made to address the graph representation learning problem, many of them still suffer from their shallow learning mechanisms. Deep learning models on graphs (e.g., graph neural networks) have recently emerged in machine learning and other related areas, and demonstrated the superior performance in various problems. In this survey, despite numerous types of graph neural networks, we conduct a comprehensive review specifically on the emerging field of graph convolutional networks, which is one of the most prominent graph deep learning models. First, we group the existing graph convolutional network models into two categories based on the types of convolutions and highlight some graph convolutional network models in details. Then, we categorize different graph convolutional networks according to the areas of their applications. Finally, we present several open challenges in this area and discuss potential directions for future research.},

We find that coupled correlations are not only multifractal but also anti-persistent. Compared with Guangzhou, Hangzhou has stronger correlations. Both long-range correlation and fat-tailed distribution can cause the coupled multifractality. and the long-range correlation has a greater influence on the coupled multifractality.

To address these issues, this paper develops a residual graph convolution long short-term memory (RGC-LSTM) model for spatial-temporal data forecasting considering the network topology. This model integrates a new graph convolution operator for spatial modelling on networks and a residual LSTM structure for temporal modelling considering multiple periodicities. The proposed model has few parameters, low computational complexity, and a fast convergence rate. The framework is evaluated on both the 10-min traffic speed data from Shanghai, China and the 5-min Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS) traffic flow data. Experiments show the advantages of the proposed approach over various state-of-the-art baselines, as well as consistent performance across different datasets.},

To develop an effective response strategy for this risk transfer, this paper constructs an interdependent stock-fund network to describe the relationship between the two markets and proposes a risk transfer model to investigate the risk transfer process between them. This model is applied to stock and OEF markets in China. Through a sensitivity analysis of three variables including the initial impact level of risk, the OEF liquidation line, and the stock discount rate, the changes in the OEF liquidation rate and the stock index under different conditions are analysed quantitatively. The results show the following: (1) The OEF liquidation rate and stock index have obvious percolation processes with the changes in the three parameters; (2) Risks are transferred between the two markets more rapidly when the parameters are larger than their thresholds; and (3) Affected by the size of the OEFs and the market value of the stocks, the initial impact level of risk and the OEF liquidation line have more significant impacts on the two markets than the stock discount rate. The proposed models can assist the decision makers in better understanding the risk transfer process between stock and OEF markets and to select effective strategies to respond to different risks.},

Besides, Markov process is utilized to assess the propagation patterns of pollutants at every monitored site and further to trace the potential pollution sources.

The analysis is based on the traffic crash fatalities in Florida during the period 1975--2015. A detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) and a detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) are used for capturing the long-memory auto-correlations and the cross-correlations, respectively. The investigation is conducted through the following steps: (1) identifying the periodicity of the traffic fatalities series via traditional signal processing methods; (2) removing the season effects identified by simple average value analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) from the original time series; (3) based on the original and processed series, exploring the long-memory auto-correlations and cross-correlations in the time series data of different road users. The results of DFA indicate that the auto-correlations of the fluctuations in the daily fatalities are positive for all road users regardless of the seasonal effects. The results of DCCA indicate that the fluctuation in the fatalities for any type of road user is positively associated with that for other road users. The fluctuation in traffic fatalities for any road user is therefore not random-walk but correlated to their fluctuations in the last time unit and that of other road users during the same period. The findings of this study add to the understanding of the long-memory property in traffic fatalities and provide implications for the development of time series models in the traffic safety field.},

  abstract = {Mobile edge computing supports the connected cars to ensure real-time, interactive, secured, and distributed services for customers. Connected car-sharing systems, as the promising appliance of connected cars, provide a convenient transportation mode for citizens' intra-urban commutes. Determining the locations of depots is the primary job in connected car-sharing systems. Existing methods mainly use qualitative method and do not consider spatial--temporal dynamic travel demands. This article proposes a mobile edge computing--based connected car framework which uses normal taxis as connected cars to describe their Global Positioning System trajectory and perform the computing tasks in each mobile edge computing server independently. A spatial--temporal demand coverage approach is developed to optimize the location of depots. This article proposes a deep learning method to predict car-sharing demand constructed by a stacked auto-encoder model and a logistic regression layer. The stacked auto-encoder model is employed for learning the latent spatial and temporal correlation features of demand. A graph-based resource relocation model is proposed to minimize the cost of relocation considering spatio-temporal variation of car-sharing demand. Experiments performed on the large-scale real-world data sets illustrate that our proposed model has superior performance than existing methods.},

  abstract = {The categorization of high dimensional data present a fascinating challenge to statistical models as frequent number of highly correlated dimensions or attributes can affect the accuracy of model. When the underlying time series present non-stationarity, typically when the series are contaminated by external trends, the strength of cross-correlations among variables is often overestimated or underestimated, and therefore, the traditional PCA method fails to rely on reliable cross-correlations to guide for the linear transformation of original variables. In this study, we apply the non-stationary principal component analysis (NSPCA) introduced by Zhao and Shang (2015) to analysis cross-correlations between the CSI300 Index and commodity markets. The main result of this paper is that for commodity markets, utilization of the non-stationary principal component analysis (NSPCA) can improve the efficiency, with more proportion of total population variance (information) due to an equal number of principal components than the traditional PCA. Meanwhile, as the increasing of time scales, this efficiency of NSPCA has a trend to increase. To check that whether the first several principal components can preserve some important information of original data or not, we apply detrended cross-correlation analysis (DCCA) to examine cross-correlation relationship between the CSI300 Index and the selected first five principal components and conclude that the information of long-range dependence measured by Hurst exponent has not been lost.},

  abstract = {Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are the most popular products in the financial industry today. Although an extensive body of literature focuses on the multifractal analysis of some stock markets, the multifractal behavior of the ETF market have not been very widely studied. This paper aims to compare and examine the weak form efficiency and interdependence about the American ETF market comprehensively. The main contribution of this paper is as follows. First, as far as the empirical methodological framework is concerned, we apply the MF-DFA and MF-X-DFA to test and rank the efficiency of three major ETFs in the American stock market, such as SPY, DIA and QQQ. Moreover, MF-DMA and MF-X-DMA are considered to make the results more robust. Our results provided clear evidence that the American ETF market was multifractal in nature. It is noticed that QQQ exhibits the strongest level of efficiency. Second, the efficiency of the American ETF market was diminished after the global financial crisis, which is consistent with the results of Tiwari et al [1]. Furthermore, time-varying efficiency levels are determined through a rolling window approach. Third, using MF-X-DFA and MF-X-DMA, we show that there also exists multifractal characters in cross-correlations and it is anti-persistent. To the best of our knowledge, no attention has been given to investigation on cross-correlations of the American ETF market. Finally, in order to study the impacts of the global financial crisis on the multifractal behavior, we investigate and compare the multifractal properties before and after the global financial crisis. We find the multifractal characteristics of cross-correlations have been stronger after the global financial crisis.},

  abstract = {Considering the fact that crude oil markets have various noise, fluctuations and actual needs of investors in different trading cycles, in this study, we propose a multiwavelet denoising-integration MF-DCCA method by three-phase modeling to construct a portfolio among crude oil markets. On the basis of noise filtering, this method extracts the effective prediction information from different fluctuations and integrates them into the same time scale. The noise reduction and out-of-sample portfolio performance are evaluated, respectively. The robustness of out-of-sample portfolio performance is further tested by changing partial conditions The empirical results indicate that the denoising performance of multiwavelet denoising method is clearly better than the traditional wavelet denoising methods. Furthermore, in any sample period, the multiwavelet denoising-integration MF-DCCA method also performs better than the existing popular methods in terms of profitability and Sharp ratio. Besides, the long-term scales (s=60, 80) are superior to the short-term scales (s=20, 40) in most situations. Robustness results verify the above conclusions.},

The results indicate that the relationship between RMB internationalization and nonferrous metal prices reflects a complex nonlinear mechanism. There was no mutual influence between RMB internationalization and nonferrous metal prices prior to the trials of the RMB settlement in the cross-border trade in July 2009. Since then, however, a bidirectional causal relationship between RMB internationalization and the price of copper and a unidirectional causal relationship from the price of aluminum to RMB internationalization were examined. In addition, due to the impact of extreme events, such as economic and financial crises, RMB internationalization and nonferrous metal prices are not always positively correlated but are rather occasionally negatively correlated.},

The study also scrutinizes the dynamics of the efficiency of Chinese sectoral stock market by the rolling window approach. The overall empirical findings revealed that all the sectoral indices of Chinese stock market exist different degrees of multifractality. The results of different efficiency measures have agreed on that the 300 Materials index is the least efficient index. However, they have a slight diffidence on the most efficient one. The 300 Information Technology, 300 Telecommunication Services and 300 Health Care indices are comparatively efficient. We also investigate the cross-correlations between the ten sectoral indices and WTI crude oil price based on Multifractal Detrended Cross-correlation Analysis. At last, some relevant discussions and implications of the empirical results are presented.},

However, there are some major difficulties in measuring scale-free activity in neuroimaging data: they are noisy, possibly nonstationary ... Here, we make use of multifractal analysis to better understand the biological meaning of scale-free activity recorded with Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. On a cohort of 20 subjects, we demonstrate the presence of self-similarity on all sensors during rest and visually evoked activity. Also, we report significant multifractality on the norm of gradiometers. Finally, on the latter signals we show how self-similarity and multifractality are modulated between ongoing and evoked activity.},

  abstract = {Accurate long-term origin-destination demand (OD) prediction can help understand traffic flow dynamics, which plays an essential role in urban transportation planning. However, the main challenge originates from the complex and dynamic spatial-temporal correlation of the time-varying traffic information. In response, a graph deep learning model for long-term OD prediction (ST-GDL) is proposed in this paper, which is among the pioneering work that obtains both short-term and long-term OD predictions simultaneously. ST-GDL avoids the conventional multi-step forecasting and thus prevents learning from prediction errors, rendering better long-term forecasts. The proposed method captures time attributes from multiple time scales, namely closeness, periodicity, and trend, to study the features with temporal dynamics. Besides, two gate mechanisms are introduced over the vanilla convolution operation to alleviates the error accumulation issue of typical recurrent forecast in long-term OD prediction. A method based on graph convolution is proposed to capture the dynamic spatial relationship, which projects the transportation network into a graphical time-series. Finally, the long-term OD prediction results are obtained by combining the extracted spatio-temporal features with external features from the meteorological information. Case studies on a practical dataset show that the proposed model is superior to existing methods in long-term OD prediction problems.},
